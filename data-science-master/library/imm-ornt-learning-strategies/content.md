Chances are, you've never done anything like this program before. Maybe you've never tried online learning before, maybe you haven't spent a lot of time learning design, or maybe you haven't been a student in years.

This is likely a new way of learning for you—but even if it isn't, you'll want to spend time developing learning strategies that work for you. Everyone is different; someone else's tried-and-true strategy may work well for you or not at all. But we can tell you up front that if you don't have strategies for your learning, this process will be a lot harder—and it's already hard enough. So make your life easier by taking the time to consider which strategies might work for you. We have a lot of suggestions for you; try a few of them out, talk about them with your mentor, and ask your colleagues on Slack what works for them. Once you've found some strategies that resonate with you, think about how you will integrate them into your learning plan.

## The 30-minute rule
You will get stuck at least once, if not several times, during this program. Don't panic—this happens to every student. In fact, even professionals regularly get stuck. (They also happen to be experts in getting unstuck, but that's a skill you'll develop over time.) 
When you do get stuck, stop and take a step back. First, try to articulate the problem to yourself, and then try to search online for your description of the problem. There's a good chance that someone else has encountered a similar question or issue, and you may find an answer or solution online (especially on Stack Overflow, if the issue involves code). 
But how do you know if you're *truly* stuck? Here's a helpful rule: if you haven't made progress on your own in 30 minutes, you're stuck. At that point, it's best to reach out for help from your support team.

## Time management strategies
Online learning takes a lot of discipline. It's important to consider how you'll make time for this work and how you'll keep up your momentum over the next several months. Here are some tips and resources to help you effectively manage your time, efficiently work through challenges, and stay focused over the course of this program.

### Schedule your work but be realistic
It's important to actively schedule your time, ideally using a piece of paper, a planner, a digital calendar, or even a time-tracking tool. This will help you organize and plan your study sessions.
Using whichever format you prefer, start by logging all of your current responsibilities: work, sleep, childcare, and any other fixed or inflexible commitments. Next, add in the time that you plan to work on your program. When will you study? How long will you work in a given study session?
Then, record the time that you *actually* spend studying every day. At the end of the week, add up the hours and reflect on your process. How many hours did you actually work on your program? When did your planned schedule and your actual schedule line up, and when did they diverge? Using this information, how can you modify your planned schedule to make it more realistic? For instance, perhaps you originally thought you'd work on your program at the end of each day, but you've discovered that you're too exhausted. In this case, consider waking up early to work first thing in the morning.

### Don't break the chain
Putting a task—especially an unfamiliar task—on your calendar doesn't necessarily mean you'll get it done. So when you're trying to build a new habit, you might find it more helpful to mark on a calendar the days when a task *did* get done. This method is often attributed to Jerry Seinfeld and has been popularized by various people, such as author and artist Austin Kleon, as an effective strategy for time management.
Now try applying this method to your studying schedule. On a physical or digital calendar, mark every day that you worked on your program. The consecutive days that you've marked will form a chain, and your goal is to keep the chain going. Some apps, like Streaks, can help you do this, but drawing a simple grid of days on a notepad will work, too. This visual representation of the work you've done is a great motivator—it inspires you to keep working so that you don't break your streak of productivity. How many days in a row can you go?

### Maintain momentum and plan a next action
Todd Henry, host of *The Accidental Creative* podcast, recommends that you identify "a next action" at the end of every work session. In the context of this program, using that approach means that you'll always know what you have to do next. You'll be prepared to jump right into every study session, and you'll avoid that initial uncertainty and confusion when you start to work again. 
In your program, your dashboard provides you with clear next steps. But you can take this framework a step further by sketching out how you will work on every part of your program. In addition to providing clear direction and structure, this approach taps into the power of the Zeigarnik Effect, which suggests that the mind keeps thinking about unfinished business. Todd Henry's recommendation of regularly lining up a next action can keep your mind focused on the work you need to do and help you move forward in your program with specific, concrete plans.  

### Track your efforts with a work progress journal
Author and computer scientist Cal Newport suggests that keeping a work progress journal can help you stay productive. It's a quick and easy activity. In a notebook, write down the tasks you plan to complete at the beginning of the day. Then, at the end of the day, write "done" next to the completed tasks along with any additional notes. Finally, next to incomplete tasks, write an explanation of why you didn't complete them. 
To paraphrase Greg McKeown, author of *Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less*: nothing motivates quite the same way progress does. By making you more aware of how you're progressing through the program, this simple tool allows you to celebrate your daily accomplishments and helps you stay on track. The work progress journal can also help you recognize a lack of progress. If you're consistently recording why you didn't accomplish certain tasks, you can look at that data, determine what isn't working, and figure out a solution.

## Reading and studying strategies 
These programs require a lot of reading, and it can be challenging to digest written explanations of new concepts and techniques. Active reading strategies can help you stay on pace, retain information, and improve your learning patterns. 
To be an active reader, you must be engaged in the reading process before, during, and after every checkpoint or module. Follow these steps as you move through the material.
- **Before reading:** Examine the core text or assignment before you read it fully or before you dive into a project. Review and scan the text, headings, and images, draft questions that you're curious about and write down what you already know about the topic. Set a purpose or objective for the reading.
- **While reading:** Take time to pause while you're reading to think about what you've read. Visualize, journal, and annotate as you go and consider how ideas in the text connect to other ideas you've read about, a project you're working on, or the larger ecosystem of your program. Turn concepts into questions that can be answered, and then answer those questions.
- **After reading:** When you've finished reading, stop to reflect on what you've read before moving to the next section. Practice critical-thinking exercises, and consider why this material is part of the curriculum. Write out your unanswered questions and ideas you're still confused about and make a list of the concepts you feel like you understand. 

There are many tried-and-true learning strategies that you can use to improve your reading and studying skills. In addition to being an active reader, you can try out the techniques below.

### Read linearly 
Perhaps not surprisingly, smartphones and social media have fundamentally changed how people read and retain information. Many people quickly skim articles and jump from headline to headline, often struggling to read long-form text from beginning to end. Although it might take time—and patience—to settle back into reading words and sentences in sequential order, you'll get far more value out of this program if you read all the content, line by line, in this curriculum. In the long run, reading linearly will make you a more efficient and effective reader, and you're more likely to actually retain the information.

### Take handwritten notes
Along with active, linear reading, you should take notes on what you read. Taking notes helps with information retention, and it seems to be most beneficial when done by hand.

### Explain it to someone else
To test whether or not you understand a concept, try explaining it to someone else. Explaining concepts in your own words, posing questions to yourself and others, and articulating points of confusion will force you to engage fully with the material. These processes and activities can offer insight into what you understand and show you where you're struggling or getting stuck. 
You can practice explaining a concept to your mentor, to another student on Slack, to your roommate or partner, or even to yourself! In fact, talking out loud to yourself has many benefits, and it can help strengthen your understanding. If this strategy feels awkward, check out the *Harvard Business Review* article ["Talking to Yourself (Out Loud) Can Help You Learn"](https://hbr.org/2017/05/talking-to-yourself-out-loud-can-help-you-learn) for some easy-to-use guidance. You can also try translating your thoughts into words or pictures on a piece of paper or whiteboard.

### Focus on depth, not breadth
You'll complete several assignments in this program. As you work, give yourself enough time to carefully read the materials and let new concepts sink in. It's better to take twice as long reading deliberately, with full concentration, than it is to get through twice as many assignments with shallow comprehension. After all, if you're completing assignments without fully understanding the processes or concepts behind them, you'll only be doing your career a disservice. Your lack of understanding will be clear to employers during a job interview, for instance.

### Resist rabbit holes
When you're working through your program, you will inevitably run into concepts that you want to learn more about. That's a good thing—curiosity, inquisitiveness, and a desire to understand are great qualities that should be nurtured. However, when researching concepts online, you'll find that it's easy to get sucked down rabbit holes of articles or videos that ultimately lead you astray. So when you set out to investigate an idea further, try using the Pomodoro Technique. 
This technique is a proven productivity strategy. Simply set a timer and work—or conduct your internet research—without interruption until the timer rings. This can help you maintain focus and let you know when you've spent enough time on a task. It's also helpful when you're problem-solving or troubleshooting; you track how much time you've spent fixing an issue so you know when to ask for help. Just be sure to set your timer for a reasonable amount of time.
