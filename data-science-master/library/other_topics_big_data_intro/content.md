Big data. It's undoubtedly something you've heard of before. And depending on what stories you've been reading, you've probably heard one of two things: You may have heard that big data is about dealing with the enormous growth in data recording and storage capabilities that has happened over the past several years. Or you may have heard that it's the answer to every problem ever.

It's not the latter.

As a data scientist, you'll be expected to be able to "speak" big data. This module will give you the skills and understanding to work with big data, as well as to know what that really means. You'll be learning about the architecture at a high level and learning the language to know how to dig deeper should you run into these situations in the future. 

That said, this will not be an in-depth look at implementations. You should be able to approach those problems with the combination of the high-level understanding presented here and the analogous experience that you've already gained elsewhere in the program.

Read these checkpoints to get familiar with the concepts and learn what tools may be useful. The hope is that you will come out of this module understanding what distinguishes big data and knowing about some of the tools that you may encounter in that space.
