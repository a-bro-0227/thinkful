In this checkpoint, you'll be introduced to variables, one of the fundamental building blocks of programming. You'll explore what variables are and why they're useful. Then, you'll learn about the different kinds of data types that a variable can take on in Python.


## What is a variable?

Simply put, a *variable* is a name that is attached to a value.

Variables open up two possibilities for you as a programmer.

First, they give you a shorthand way to refer to values created elsewhere in a program. You can declare and define a variable once, then pass that value around in your code without having to rewrite the value each time. And second, they provide a way to manage state. You'll see examples and learn more about both of these functionalities below.

After the Jupyter Notebook below loads, read over the code in the first cell, then execute it.
