So far in this module, you have learned what *classification* means and what types of problems classification algorithms solve. You have also looked at several common classification algorithms and learned how to implement them using the scikit-learn library. You have seen that using the scikit-learn implementations of the algorithms is fairly straightforward. However, using the algorithms with the default parameters is uncommon.

In this checkpoint, you are going to focus some attention on one subset of classification algorithms known as *linear classifiers*. You will take a deep dive into how these algorithms work, and you'll examine how the parameters affect them.
