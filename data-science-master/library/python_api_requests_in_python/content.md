In the previous checkpoint, you saw that to get data from an API, you need to make an HTTP request to a specific endpoint.

In this checkpoint, you will look at ways to make that request with Python code. An HTTP request consists of the base URL, the endpoint path, parameters, and possibly authentication headers. The response to an HTTP request also requires some effort to process: you have to check that the request was successful, extract the data in an appropriate format, and process the data in some meaningful way.
