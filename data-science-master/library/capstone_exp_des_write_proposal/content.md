For your first capstone, you'll complete a business research project. This will ultimately include the following deliverables:

- A one-page proposal to be approved by the Thinkful team
- A Jupyter Notebook that tells a compelling story about your data
- A 15-30 minute presentation of your findings. You'll need to produce a slide deck and present it to the Thinkful community.


For this checkpoint, you'll find a real-life dataset and draft a research proposal. 


## Assignment

The previous module covered how to design and evaluate research projects and statistically analyze the results. Now, it's your turn to complete an end-to-end data analysis study. For this assignment, do the following:


1. Locate an interesting dataset to test. For this kind of analysis, a tabular dataset in CSV format is likely to be most common. For some ideas on where to find data, check out [this Thinkful resource guide](https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/data-201-resources/blob/master/data-sources.md). Also, consider subscribing to [Data is Plural](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural), which describes itself as a "weekly newsletter of useful/curious datasets." You can [view its archive here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0). In your proposal, provide a link to any datasets that you plan to test. Make sure to describe what the data is and why it's interesting.


2. Submit a research proposal for an experiment that tests a hypothesis that can be answered by the tests covered in this module. Explain how you plan to test this hypothesis using the data source. Include in your proposal why this hypothesis is interesting, who might be interested in this research, and what your audience would gain from the research. Your audience doesn't have to be business executivesâ€”it could be any group, from sports fans to physicians!

This deliverable could be a Google Doc or possibly a Jupyter Notebook. It is primarily text based rather than code driven; however, you may want to explore the data a bit to get a better sense of what analysis might be possible.

The Thinkful team will use the following rubric when assessing your work:

>1. Data
>
>    - Student has clearly described what the dataset is and why it's interesting.
>    - Student has provided a link to the dataset.
>  
>2. Research design
>
>    - Proposal has a clear research or business question.
>    - Student identifies at least one hypothesis that they plan to test.
>    - Student states how they will test the hypothesis using their data source.
>  
>3. Audience
>
>    - Proposal clearly outlines the user or stakeholder who this research will be valuable for.
>    - Proposal identifies why the audience will benefit from the research's findings.

When you're done, save a copy of your proposal somewhere publicly accessible on the web. Submit a link below, and you'll receive feedback on your work.
