Now is your chance to show your understanding of the data science workflow.

For this stage, create a Notebook that builds and demonstrates your data science product. Reference other scripts as needed, but make sure to include those in the same repo. This Notebook should demonstrate your technical prowess as well as your skills in visualization and narrative storytelling. As such, it should include all stages of your process in a clean, easy-to-read format.

Specifically, make sure to do the following:

* **Wrangle your data:** Get your data into the Notebook in the best format possible for your analysis and model-building.
* **Explore your data:** Make visualizations and conduct statistical analyses to explain what's happening with your data, why it's interesting, and what features you intend to take advantage of for your modeling.
* **Build a modeling pipeline:** Build your model in a coherent pipeline of linked stages that is efficient and easy to implement.
* **Evaluate your models:** You should have built multiple models, which you should thoroughly evaluate and compare via a robust analysis of residuals and failures.
* **Present and thoroughly explain your product:** Describe your model in detail: why you chose it, why it works, what problem it solves, and how it will run in a production-like environment. What would you need to do to maintain it going forward?
