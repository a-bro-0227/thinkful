Visualizations can be a powerful tool for storytelling with data. Often, a plot or graph is essential for demonstrating patterns in data; these patterns may be difficult or impossible to discern by just looking through the raw data. Visualizations can help you tell a story with the data by highlighting trends or outliers.

In this checkpoint, you'll look at the graphing capabilities of the [Seaborn data visualization library](https://seaborn.pydata.org/). This library works well with pandas and with other popular visualization libraries. Note that Seaborn is based on the famous [Matplotlib plotting library](https://matplotlib.org/index.html)â€”so if you want to take a deeper dive into how plots work, that should be your next stop.
