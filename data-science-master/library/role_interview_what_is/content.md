This checkpoint serves as a high-level overview of the role interview using the 5 W's framework familiar to you from earlier checkpoints. In the next checkpoint, you'll be provided with pointers for before, during, and after the role interview. 

## What is a role interview?

A role interview typically lasts about 45 minutes to an hour and is a discussion about the candidate's understanding of the role, what challenges they might face, and how they would address them. It is a close look at how the candidate's experience matches up to what is called for in the job interview. 

## When is a role interview in the interview process?

These are often the second, and perhaps semifinal, interviews, which are done after a phone screen but before a technical or whiteboard interview. However, this does not mean the role interview is less important than a technical interviewâ€”in fact, it could be argued that assessing one's professional aptitude and transferable skills is more important than getting a read on technical chops, which is why the technical interview comes *after* the role interview. 

## Where is a role interview conducted?

Generally, after the phone screen, interviews move to in-person, or if that's not logistically possible, video interviews. The role interview follows this pattern. 

## Who conducts a role interview?

There is variability here. Some organizations might have human resources conduct this earlier-phase interview, and only get the hiring team (that is, the data science team) involved when it comes time to do the technical interview. However, some role interviews might take a deeper dive into profession-specific questions, in which case the data science team might take the reins. 

## Why is a role interview conducted? 

The role interview shares some qualities with the phone screen in that the focus is on the candidate's knowledge of the organization and their professional aptitude. However, the phone screen serves a different purpose: to screen out candidates who do not possess all the necessary qualities to proceed as a candidate.

A role interview, on the other hand, is not so much about *whether* you are qualified as a candidate, but *how* you would approach the role given your knowledge and experience. That said, as a first-time data scientist, it can take more effort to provide satisfactory explanations as to why your work experience has prepared you to handle what is entailed in this role. In the next checkpoint, you will learn specific tactics for how to bridge the gap between your experience and what a potential job might require.

## Assignment

Gather two or three job descriptions for roles that you are particularly interested in or feel particularly qualified for. In the next checkpoint, you will parse them closely to prepare for a role interview.
