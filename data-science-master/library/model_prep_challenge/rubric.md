Regardless of if students pass the checkpoint or not, please provide actionable feedback to them to help them improve or to give them guidance on what they need to work on to pass next time.

Learning context:
This checkpoint is a summative assessment of what the student has learned in the Model preparation module. At this point, they know about data cleaning, data exploration, and feature engineering. We look to this assessment to build confidence that the student can satisfactorily do exploratory data analysis (EDA) and its substeps. Their goal in this challenge is to find the factors that affect life expectancy in countries, specifically which factors increase the expected life expectancy and which factors decrease it.

Rubric:
Students must achieve 7/10 points in order to pass. To complete this challenge, students are asked to submit a Jupyter notebook containing solutions to the following tasks:

(1 point) First, load the dataset. Student successfully loads dataset.

(3 points) Detect the problems with the data such as missing values and outliers. Are there any nonsense values that seem to be stemmed from the data collection? For the missing values, discuss which technique would be the most suitable one in filling out these values. Regarding the outliers, discuss their potential effects on your analysis and select an appropriate method to deal with them. Student successfully discusses missing value technique, effects of outliers on their analysis, and how they will deal with them.

(2 points) Explore the data using univariate and multivariate exploration techniques. You should pay special attention to your target variable. In this regard, your focus should be on finding the relevant variables that may affect life expectancy. Student successfully uses univariate and multivariate exploration techniques and finds relevant variables affecting life expectancy.

(2 points) In the feature engineering step, you need to select a suite of variables that you think would be ideal in the modeling phase. More concretely, you may discard some variables that are very correlated with the other ones or the variables that you think irrelevant with the life expectancy. Student successfully selects a suite of variables ideal in the modeling phase, and discards some that are irrelevant.

(2 points) Summarize your findings. One of the most important skills of a data scientist is to convey ideas and findings to nontechnical people using understandable language. In this regard, one of the most effective ways to communicate your ideas is to do it using effective visualization. Student successfully conveys ideas and findings using understandable language, and effective visualization.
