Earlier in this course, you were introduced to the types of interviews data scientists typically face before getting an offer. To recap, these are the four most common interview types for data scientists:

1. Phone screen
2. Behavioral interview
3. Role interview
4. Technical interview

In this checkpoint, you'll get up to speed on *behavioral interviews*. You'll learn about their purpose, why employers use them, and what employers hope to learn about you from such an interview. You'll also learn about an approach you can use to answer behavioral interview questions effectively.

## The behavioral interview

If you've ever been in a job interview, you've probably been asked a question that starts like this: "Tell me about a time when...." This type of question is part of a behavioral interview. Behavioral interviews are used to evaluate both technical and nontechnical skills. They help employers assess whether you have the expertise and knowledge to do the job *and* the ability to overcome challenges, think critically, and work well with others.

Phone screens are essentially mini-behavioral interviews that take place over the phone and are only about 15 minutes. Behavioral interviews are longer and might take place in person, depending on the job and the company.

Most behavioral interview questions focus on a few key topics: your work experience, your work style, and how you deal with obstacles. Recruiters and hiring managers ask these questions to make sure you have the skills and experience that they're looking for. But they also want to see that you're a team player, a strong communicator, and a good problem solver who can handle setbacks. Many data scientists make the mistake of preparing for a behavioral interview by cramming Python trivia or solving coding problems. While this prep work is valuable, you should prepare to highlight your soft skills, too. After all, if you don't excel at behavioral interviews, you'll never get further than the phone screen.

It's important to keep the interviewers' intent in mind as you frame your answers to behavioral interview questions. This is because many questions can feel vague and open-ended, especially ones like "Tell me about yourself." As you're preparing to answer this question, take a moment to think about what the interviewer wants to know. What does this person really want to learn or understand? How can you frame your background around the role or company? What specific examples or experiences would the interviewer care about?

The person asking this question doesn't want to know your entire life story. They want to know how your past experiences led you to be the right person for this position. Similarly, they might ask you to discuss a conflict you had with a colleague and how you resolved it. This *isn't* the time to complain about the time Mark from Accounting ate all the snacks in the breakroom. Your interviewer wants to know that you have the tact and communication skills necessary to amicably resolve an interpersonal conflict at work. So make sure your answer focuses on that.

## What to avoid in a behavioral interview

You now have an idea of what to expect in a behavioral interview. At this point, you'll focus on some common mistakes people make in these interviews and ways to avoid these pitfalls.

**Vague answers:** When people don't brainstorm possible answers before an interview, they often have trouble remembering specific details on the spot. Without specificity or clarity, their answers are a lot less impressive. You can avoid this by taking the time to prepare your responses and write them down using the STAR method, which you'll learn about below.

**Blanking:** Like providing vague answers, blanking—or completely not knowing how to answer a question—can be a real setback in an interview. When you don't spend time preparing answers in advance, you might not come up with a great example in the moment. If you put yourself in that situation, you're running the risk of completely forgetting your experiences. Imagine if the interviewer says, "Tell me about a time when you overcame an obstacle," and you respond by saying, "I can't think of anything right now." It happens to people more often than you'd think. And it's really hard to recover from.

**Rambling, long-winded answers:** Some people get really excited about their examples and want to share every detail. But this eats up valuable time in an interview, and it can make you seem like you lack self-awareness. You can avoid this by using the *STAR method* to prepare your answers (which you'll learn about below). Then, record your answers and listen to them, or practice with someone else. As a general rule, each answer should be less than 90 seconds.

**Excessive verbal tics and filler words:** Everyone has verbal tics. People often use them unconsciously when they're searching for the right word, when they're not sure what to say, or when they're nervous. But excessive use of these filler words—so, like, um, sorry, etc.—can be very off-putting in an interview, especially on the phone. These tics can make you sound unprofessional and unsure of what you're saying. They can also add unnecessary length to your answers. So, as uncomfortable as it is, try recording your answers and listening to yourself. Make a note of when, and how often, you say certain words. Doing this can help you cut down on these words in your speech.

**Underestimating the importance of politeness:** In the modern world of brevity and informality, conversational niceties are often an afterthought. But they shouldn't be. Although it seems like a small thing, a lack of politeness can make or break your success in an interview. This is not an exaggeration; don't let something like this hurt your career prospects. Make sure to start every email with a simple "How are you?" or "I hope you are well." 

Always thank the person who emailed you or interviewed you for their time. Triple-check the name of each person you interact with to make sure you're spelling or pronouncing their name correctly. (This [**YouTube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/user/ThePronounceNames) is one of many that can help you learn to pronounce a name you aren't familiar with.) And when you're in an interview, take a moment to make small talk with the interviewer. Ask about their day, what they did over the weekend, or their plans for an upcoming holiday or summer vacation. If this person feels comfortable and enjoys talking to you, they're more likely to leave the interview with a good impression of you.

## Using the STAR technique in interviews

The *STAR technique* is what most interviewers use when reviewing your answers to behavioral questions. This helps them make sure that you clearly identified the nature of their question and responded with a well-thought-out answer. They also want to see that you touched on illuminating, relevant, and important points in your response.

As you've learned, behavioral interviews can include questions like the ones below:

- "Tell me about a time when you went above and beyond what was expected of you in your position."
- "How did you handle a disagreement with a coworker?"
- "Have you ever had to deal with a disgruntled client? How did you handle that situation?"

The STAR technique uses four different concepts for behavioral questions: *Situation*, *Task*, *Action*, and *Result*, which make up the acronym *STAR*.

By using the STAR technique, interviewers can determine whether you clearly and thoughtfully described a situation, the tasks you were assigned, and the actions you took. They also want to see that you can reflect on the specific results and outcomes of that experience.

### How can you use the STAR technique to your benefit?
During the interview process, you can use the STAR technique to your advantage. You can use it to provide thorough answers to any behavioral question you're asked! These answers will help you build your professional narrative, and you can–and should–prepare them in advance of the interview. These answers normally take about one to three minutes to answer. Now, you'll learn about the four different concepts you'll be using to answer behavioral questions: *Situation*, *Task*, *Action*, and *Result*.

**Situation:** First, you'll want to set the scene for your response. Start by providing context and background for the situation you want to share. If the interviewer asks a question about teamwork experiences, your reply will need to include contextual details: what you were working on, who you were working with, when it happened, and where you were. For example, you could say, "I was collaborating with a team of five people at a marketing firm, and we were working with a new client who wanted to improve their online presence and get more website traffic." Be as specific as possible.

**Task:** Describe the specific responsibilities or roles you had in the situation, for example: "I was tasked with working with the contracted web developer to gather data on audience acquisition and on-site behavior." Focus on your own personal tasks and duties rather than on the entire team's role.

**Action:** At this point, you'll describe how you completed your task. This is the most important part of the STAR technique, as it is where you describe the steps you took to work collaboratively and get the job done. Remember to focus on what *you* did specifically rather than what the larger team was working on. Take this opportunity to highlight your contributions and prove that you possess the skills the interviewer is looking for. You could say, "Working with the developer, I was able to identify an increase in the use of the mobile site on iOS and Android. I passed this information back to the developer who made the site more mobile-friendly."

**Result:** Finally, you want to explain the results of the situation. They should be positive and, ideally, quantifiable. For example, "Within the first month, we increased the client's overall user traffic by 33%. It increased by 5% week-over-week for the remainder of the quarter." You'll also want to share any lessons that you learned from the situation, and you might want to discuss anything that you would do differently if you were faced with a similar situation.

## Creating your personal story: The STAR technique in action

The STAR technique can help you shape better responses to behavioral interview questions. But you can also use this technique to improve a key component of your networking experience: your personal story.

Your personal story tells people how you've gotten to this point in your career. It *does not* tell your entire life story. The personal story is an excellent tool to have on hand in an interview or when meeting new people—connections, networking contacts, colleagues, etc. You can use the STAR technique to help you craft your personal story by touching on each component mentioned above as you build your response.

For example, suppose you're at a networking event, and you meet a recruiter from a company that you're very interested in working with. She asks you: "What inspired you to pursue a career in data science?"

First, **set the stage** for your response.


> Two years ago, I was on the customer success team at a tech company that specializes in an iOS app. It was a midsize team that handled 300 tickets per day. With so much exposure to our customers, I realized there was a serious disconnect between our customer base and our product team. So I started working as a product liaison to bridge that gap. The more I became involved with our product team, the more I saw the importance of collecting actionable data from our products to make informed decisions about them.

Next, talk about what **task** you took on.


> I started small, teaching myself basic data analysis with a few Udemy courses to see if data science was something I was interested in. After six months of working on R and SQL by myself, I enrolled in an apprenticeship to learn more about the field and build up my portfolio.

Next, talk about the **actions** you took. Make sure you highlight what you did on the team and how you were able to reach your goals.


> I completed a series of projects in my apprenticeship. For example, I analyzed a dataset of housing prices to uncover which variables significantly influenced sales prices. I also built a model to predict which customers will churn given the data generated by help tickets. I could have definitely benefited from this model in my previous role! 


And finally, wrap up your personal story with the **result**.

> After this series of projects, I've learned how to gather, wrangle, and build end-to-end data science products. I've also learned a lot more about building robust, reproducible code throughout the process, and I'm constantly looking to improve my skills with more experiences.
