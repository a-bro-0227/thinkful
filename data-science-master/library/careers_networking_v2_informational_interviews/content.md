## Learning objective

By the end of this checkpoint, you should be able to **conduct informational interviews with professionals in your desired industry**.


## Overview

Informational interviews are a powerful networking tool. They can grow your network, connect you to people who work at companies or in jobs that interest you, pair you with a mentor, and provide valuable information about how you can refine your job search and prepare for an interview. 

But what are informational interviews? They're one-on-one conversations with someone who has a job that you might like, who works within an industry you might want to enter, or who is employed by a specific company that you're interested in learning about. Essentially, it's getting coffee with someone whose knowledge or experience can benefit you. 

And they're pretty easy to set up. Most people are more than happy to share their insights, tips, and connections with you; you just need to make the effort to set up a meeting and ask the right questions. 

This checkpoint covers the best practices of setting up, preparing for, and conducting informational interviews. 


## Setting up an informational interview

Setting up an informational interview is easier than you think. All you need to do is determine who you want to meet and then extend an invitation. Here are a few tips.


### Determining who you should interview

Informational interviews are an opportunity for you to glean insights and tips from industry experts—people who work in a job, company, or industry that interests you. They can be people who are already in your network (or your network's network) or complete strangers. 


#### Utilizing your network

When thinking about who you want to conduct an informational interview with, it's easiest to start by considering your network. Your family, your current and past friends, classmates, and coworkers, as well as _their_ friends and family and so on. Who among this group works in a job or at a company that interests you? Those are good people to interview. 


#### Utilizing strangers

While it's nice if there are already people in your network who you can interview, there's no need to limit yourself. It's perfectly okay—and encouraged—to conduct informational interviews with complete strangers. Most strangers are happy to share their knowledge and advice with you. You just need to ask politely. (Think about it. If a stranger told you that they're considering enrolling in your same Thinkful program but wanted to first hear what someone in the program thought of it, you'd probably be willing to indulge them, right?)

You can find these friendly strangers by browsing the team pages of company websites or searching LinkedIn for people who work in roles at companies that interest you.


### Requesting an informational interview

Once you determine who you'd like to conduct an informational interview with, the next step is to ask that person if they’re willing to meet with you. The formality of your request depends on your relationship to the person you’d like to meet with.  


#### Direct outreach

If you want to conduct an informational interview with someone in your personal network, like a friend or former coworker, just call, text, or email the person and ask if they're willing to chat about their experience. 


#### Warm outreach

If the person you want to connect with is a stranger to you but is connected to someone in your network, ask your common connection if they're willing to make an email introduction, and then go from there.


#### Cold outreach

If the person is a complete stranger with no common connections, like someone you discovered on LinkedIn, you can send them a message on LinkedIn or, if you have their email address, email them. 

Whichever method you choose, your message should start with your request, be brief, be personalized, be respectful, and provide context. As well, make your request one that's easy for the person to say yes to. Meaning, while in-person hangouts are best for establishing a relationship, be okay with talking over the phone or via a virtual hangout if that's better for the person you're interviewing. Suggest meeting in a location that's easy for the person to get to, like their office or favorite coffee shop; offer to pay for their coffee (and actually do). Finally, request meeting for 30 minutes instead of an hour. 

Here's an example of how you might ask a stranger to conduct an informational interview with you: 


>Hi, Luis,
>
>Would you be willing to get coffee with me in the next month? My treat, and I promise to only take 30 minutes of your time!
>
>My name is Taylor and I'm currently studying product management, with the goal of applying those skills to the medical industry.
>
>Because I'm new to this, I'm hoping to connect with some seasoned professionals in my area who would be willing to share some of their experience and advice—the things you maybe would have benefited from knowing when you started out. 
>
>I'm particularly interested in talking to you, since you're a product manager at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, and because I'm a fan of your Medium posts (my favorite is the one about agile methodologies).
>
>Thank you and I hope to chat more soon! 
>Taylor


If two weeks pass and the person hasn't responded, it's okay to check back in. It's possible that they didn't see or forgot to respond to your message. Here's an example of a good follow-up:


>Hey, Sofia, 
>
>Just in case you missed my last message, I wanted to circle back and see if you're able to talk sometime in the next few weeks. If coffee doesn't work, a quick phone call or Google Hangout would be great too. 
>
>Hope you're having a nice week!
>
>Respectfully, 
>Sam


If the person responds and says that they're willing to meet, it's your job to coordinate the details of the meeting and accommodate their schedule. Respond by thanking them in advance for their time, suggesting possible times to meet (ideally within the next week so that you're not forgotten), emphasizing your flexibility and willingness to accommodate their schedule and preferences, and expressing enthusiasm for when the chat does happen. For example:


>Thanks so much for agreeing to this! I can't wait! 
>
>Are you available any morning or evening next week at a coffee shop near your office—or any other time and place that's convenient for you? 
>
>Gratefully,
>Orly


Then go from there. That's it! 

To stay organized and effective, keep track of the names and dates of the people you reach out to so that you know when to follow up. Pay attention to which styles of messages get the most positive responses and adjust your future messages accordingly. 

If at first you don't succeed, try again. Worst-case scenario is that someone says no. That's okay. Someone else—multiple people, even—will say yes. 


## Preparing for an informational interview

After you schedule an informational interview, you should do two things: research the person you're interviewing, and make a list of questions to ask them during the interview. 


### Researching the person you're interviewing

Spending some time researching the person you're going to conduct an informational interview with (as well as the company that they work for) helps you determine what questions you should ask during your interview and gives you casual topics to connect on. For example, "I saw that you have a degree in anthropology; how did you make the transition to software development?" or, "I was checking out your LinkedIn profile and saw that you spent some time studying abroad. Do you miss Prague?" 

To learn about the person you're interviewing, look at their LinkedIn profile and their personal website or blog (if they have one). Also familiarize yourself with a general idea of their current company's products and services. 


### Preparing a list of questions for your informational interview

When you invite someone to meet with you for an informal interview, it's your job to drive the interview, which means coming prepared with questions to ask. The important thing to remember is that you're conducting this interview to get information—not a job. This means that while most work-related questions are acceptable, some questions are inappropriate to ask. 

Below are a few ideas of the types of questions that are okay to ask and the types of questions that you should avoid. 


#### Good questions to ask during an informational interview

* How did you get into this industry?
   - Is there anything that you'd do differently if you were in my place? 
* How do you spend your time most days? 
* Can you tell me about some of the projects that you've gotten to work on? 
* What do you like and dislike about your job?
* What resources do you use to stay sharp? 
* Do you attend any meetups or associations that you like?
* What tips do you have for someone starting out in this field?  
* If you were hiring, what would you look for in a candidate?
    - What would differentiate a good candidate and an outstanding candidate on paper or during interviews? 
* What type of questions do you usually ask during interviews? 
* Is there anyone in your network who I should connect with?
* What companies should I look into?  
* Would it be okay if I reached out again in the future if I have more questions?

Tip: Don't just think about the questions that you want to ask; actually write them down. This helps you stay organized and appear professional. It also facilitates a natural conclusion to the meeting, since you can say, "You've answered all of my questions. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to me." 


#### Bad questions to ask during an informational interview

* Will you hire me? 
* Will you refer me for this position at your company? 
* Will you give me an internship? 
* How much do you get paid? 

If the informational interview goes well and you make a good impression, the person might offer you this help or information. However, but you should _not_ be the one to ask for it. 


## Conducting an informational interview

Finally, when it's time to meet and conduct the informational interview (the fun part), here are some ~~manners~~ best practices to keep in mind.


### Being punctual

The person you're talking to is doing you a favor. Don't waste their time. This means arriving five minutes early if you're meeting in person, or exactly on time if you're meeting over the phone or virtually. And it means ending the meeting when you said you would, even if you're not finished with your questions. (It's okay if you end up talking longer, but only if the person is given the option to leave and chooses to stay.) 


### Being professional

Even though it's not a job interview, dress and act the part of the role that you want. Additionally, have a pen and paper or computer ready to take notes on. 


### Showing gratitude

Thank the person you're talking to at the beginning _and_ end of your meeting for taking time out of their busy schedule to meet with you and sharing their wisdom.

If you meet at a coffee shop or something similar, you should offer to pay for the person's order. Most of the time they'll insist on paying for themselves, but it's a nice gesture on your part. 


### Following up

After the informational interview, send an additional thank you email or message within 24 hours. Ask if the person is open to staying in touch. If they are, check in every few weeks whenever you have updates or can share how the person's advice has benefited you. 

Also, follow up with any referrals or contacts that the person recommends.
