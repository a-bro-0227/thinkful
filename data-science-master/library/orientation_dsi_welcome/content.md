Welcome to the prep course for Thinkful's immersion data science program. What you're reading right now is called a *checkpoint*.

This checkpoint explains what the prep course is all about.


## What's the point of prep?

The overall goal of prep is twofold:


- To help you decide whether or not data science is the right direction for you to move in professionally. 
- To help you decide whether or not Thinkful is the right place for you to pursue that goal.

This prep course is designed to take you through a series of curriculum modules and tasks that will empower you to make these decisions. Specifically, you'll learn about what data science is like as a profession and discipline, along with the basics of programming and exploring data in Python. 

In working through the course materials to support these objectives, you'll be able to make an informed decision about your professional development. You'll have a better idea of the role of the data scientist, and you'll get a sense of whether or not you enjoy learning and practicing some of the core skills data scientists use on a daily basis. 


## What's in prep?

From your dashboard, you'll find that there is a set of distinct tasks you must complete in order to complete the prep program.  Specifically, you'll need to complete each of the following.


- Orientation to DSI Prep (You are reading part of this module now.).
- First steps into data science
- Python for data scientists I: Programming fundamentals
- Python for data scientists II: Accessing data
- Python for data scientists III: Pandas
- Python fundamentals exam



## How long will this course take?

Most people take around two to three weeks to complete the prep course, though it's certainly possible to do it in less calendar time. This assumes that you're spending around 20/hours a week on the course. 


## Finding your best professional path forward

The point of this course is to help you make a sound decision about whether or not to pursue data science as a profession, and whether or not Thinkful is the best path forward for your particular needs.

While Thinkful strives for everyone to complete the prep course, some people will learn early on that data science is not a good fit. If that becomes clear to you, no worries! It's better to come to that realization early! 

Assume the best case though; that you will complete the prep course. When you're done, you should spend some time checking in with yourself about your enthusiasm level for moving in this direction professionally.

You'll also want to think through whether or not Thinkful's immersive data science program is the right place to pursue your professional goal. Keep in mind that you only get a taste of the immersive experience. If you choose to join the immersive bootcamp, you'll be participating in a full-time, remote classroom experience with a cohort of fellow students, a lead instructor, and a teaching assistant.  You'll also have a personal mentor you meet with twice a week. Altogether, the DSI program can truly accelerate your path to becoming a data scientist, and hopefully you'll choose to learn with Thinkful.
