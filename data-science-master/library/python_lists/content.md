So far, you've learned the basics of working with variables, numbers, strings, functions, logical operators, and control flow in Python. In the examples and drills, you've been operating on single inputs; the functions that you've created have worked on one name or one set of numbers or one weather forecast at a time.

In this checkpoint, you'll learn about collecting a group of data together in a *list* data structure. You'll also learn about using *loops* to iterate over the data contained in a list or another sequence.

As a programmer and a data scientist, you'll work with collections of data all the time. Proficiency with lists and loops is a key step in that direction.

At the end of this checkpoint, you'll work through a set of drills where you'll practice the concepts that you learned about.
