It is essential that you prepare for a behavioral interview. To orient yourself, spend some time on the website of the company that's interviewing you. Try to learn as much as you can about them. What do they build? What tech do they use? What kind of data do they have? What's their culture like? Has their CEO written anything about the company? 

Putting in the time to learn about a company demonstrates that you're serious about the role. It will also help you frame your answers more effectively. Also, take a moment to visit the company's Glassdoor profile to see if other people have reviewed their interview process. Specifically, check if anyone has written about their experience or shared the interview questions they were asked. This information can help you prepare for your own interview.

In an initial phone screen, you'll probably have 15 to 20 minutes to make an impression. If your answers aren't concise and polished, you probably won't make it to the next round. Before the interview, prepare your answers to the questions below. Do *not* try to answer these questions off the cuff. If you do, your answers will be rambling and imprecise.

Here are some common questions that you might be asked at an initial interview. Prepare brief, yet thoughtful answers to each of these questions. Write out your ideas using the STAR method (which you learned about in a previous module). Record yourself and listen back to your answers. As clich√©d as it sounds, you've only got one chance to make a first impression. If you don't prepare, it will show.


- Tell me about yourself.
- Why are you interested in data science?
- What interests you about this role?
- Why do you want to work for this company?
- Tell me about one of your accomplishments.
- Tell me about a project you've done that you are proud of.
- Tell me about a challenge that you overcame.
- Tell me about a time that you had a conflict with a colleague.
- What's the most important thing you learned at Thinkful?
- What unique qualities would you bring to this team?
- What's your biggest weakness?
- What's important to you when you think about where you work?
- Where do you see yourself in five years?

Some questions might be more specific to data science. If this is your first job where you will be formally working with data, offer your experiences from Thinkful, or answer using related elements from previous roles. For example, maybe you have not managed a data science project, but you have organized a major public event for a former organization. How did you manage that event?


- Can you describe a data modeling project that you have worked on?
- What challenges have you encountered while working with large datasets?
- Tell me about the most exciting data project you have worked on.
- Tell me about a time when you had to present dense technical information to a nontechnical audience.
- Tell me about a time when you had to go above and beyond to gather data.
- Describe a long-term data science project that you managed. How did you keep everything moving along?
- Describe a data science project which involved several parties and tasks. How did you keep the project going?
- Describe a time when you were the resident technical expert. How did you make sure everyone was able to understand you?
- Tell me about a time when you had to explain a complex topic to a frustrated client.
- Tell me about the best presentation you've given and why you think it was a hit.

Also, make sure to come prepared with two or three questions to ask the interviewer. For example, you can ask about the company, role, or team. Under no circumstances should you ask no questions; you *absolutely must* ask questions. Here are some examples of good questions to ask:


- What are the most important qualities someone should bring to this role?
- What's the biggest challenge that the team or company is facing right now?
- How is success measured for this role?
- What is your favorite thing about working at this company? (People love answering this one!)

Note: some initial interviews will be extremely short. In these cases, the company just wants to confirm that you're human. So, don't be surprised if some initial conversations only last five minutes.

## Assignment
