## Learning objective

By the end of this checkpoint, you should be able to leverage your current network during your job search.


## Overview

Think about everyone you're connected to: your family, your friends, your current and former coworkers and classmates, your acquaintances, your social media connections, that person you always see at your favorite coffee shop. This is your current network.

Although it's always helpful to grow your network, you probably already know someone who works in your desired field. Or perhaps you know someone who knows someone who works in your desired field. And this connection can be invaluable for your job search. Remember, [most jobs are never advertised](https://www.businessinsider.com/at-least-70-of-jobs-are-not-even-listed-heres-how-to-up-your-chances-of-getting-a-great-new-gig-2017-4) and you're [more likely to get a job when someone at the company refers you](https://thejobsauce.com/is-landing-a-job-really-about-who-you-know/).

Plus, if you're nervous about networking with strangers, it can be nice to start by engaging your current network—people who you already know or are connected to.  

This checkpoint helps you identify who is in your current network and determine the best ways to connect. 


## Identifying your network 

First things first. Take some time to identify who is in your current network. Make a list of everyone you know who might be able to boost your job search. This list will also be handy for future networking checkpoints. Here are some people to consider: 

- **People in your desired field:** Who in your network works in your desired field? Add them to your list. 
- **People at companies that you might like to work at:** What companies or types of companies interest you? If you know people who work at these companies, add them to your list. Even if they don't have the specific job that you want, they probably know or could easily find someone at the company who does.
- **People who know someone in your desired field:** Who do you know who knows someone who works in your desired field or at a company that interests you? Add them to your list. People are generally happy to make an introduction for you or share any wisdom that they've gained. 
- **People who orbit around you:** Who do you need to reach out to? Who are the people you see or interact with regularly—the people who could be in your network if you'd just introduce yourself? You never know if your barista, the people who share your coworking space, or the stranger in line next to you at the grocery store is the key to your next networking revelation. So get in the habit of starting casual conversations with the people around you, and see where it takes you. 


## Engaging your network

When you have a robust list of people at your fingertips, it's time to start engaging. 

In-person meetings [tend to get the most positive responses](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/296590), but even a short video chat, email, or social media message is a good place to start. 

For everyone who you reach out to, do the following:

* **Tell them your career goals.** 
* **Tell them how they can help you.** This could include sharing their personal experience with you, connecting you with someone in their network, keeping you in mind for job opportunities, or sharing your resume with their hiring managers.
* **Tell them how much you appreciate them.** No one likes feeling used. Be kind, personable, and gracious to everyone who takes the time to talk to you. 

You may be surprised to learn how willing and eager people are to help you—they just need to know how.
