## Learning objective

By the end of this checkpoint, you should be able to explain the purpose of the Careers course.

## Overview

Most Thinkful students want to change careers or level up in their current job. But changing careers or jobs can be challenging and requires both technical and nontechnical skills. This Careers course, which is made up of several career-focused modules, exists to teach you the nontechnical skills that you need for your job search. 

Before you start, here's an overview of the topics that the Careers course covers: 

* **Networking:** In this module, you'll learn to tell your professional story, leverage your current network, and confidently navigate informational interviews, meetups, and other industry-specific events.
* **Personal branding:** In this module, you'll receive guidance and feedback as you develop a compelling resume and employer-friendly online profiles. 
* **Job searching:** In this module, you'll learn effective job-search habits, how to find and apply to jobs, and how to write standout cover letters. 
* **Interviewing:** In this module, you'll receive training and practice for each step of the interview processâ€”from the phone screen to salary negotiations. 

These modules are woven throughout your technical training so that you can apply them immediately and be ready for your next job by the time that you graduate. 

And you're not alone! Both your mentor and the careers team will work with you to ensure that you're prepared for your job search before you graduate. After you graduate and complete the mentor-led portion of your program, you will continue to work with the careers team throughout your job search. 

Your job search will require a lot of hard work and stretch you beyond your comfort zone. While the careers team won't place you in a job or conduct your job search for you, they will provide you with resources, guidance, feedback, and support, including the following: 

* Checkpoints that show you how to present yourself as a competent and desirable candidate.
* Ask me anything (AMA) workshops that set you up for success as you approach your job search. This is a space where you can ask members of the careers team any questions that pertain to the Careers course and your job search. ([You can sign up for workshops here](https://www.thinkful.com/open-sessions/qa-sessions/careers/).)
* Postgraduation access to 1-on-1, individualized career coaching and group coaching sessions.
* Technical practice to prepare you for technical evaluations.
* Company referrals to opportunities in our network, when applicable.

Now, it's time to get started!
