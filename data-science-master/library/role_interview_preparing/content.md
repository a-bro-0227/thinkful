Congratulations! You've made it past a phone screen and a behavioral interview. If you were fundamentally not a good match for the job, you wouldn't be at the role interview now. Here, the question is not so much "Does this candidate have what it takes for this position at all?" as it is "Does this candidate know what they are getting themselves into?" 

The objective of this checkpoint is to provide you with actionable tips on preparing for a role interview, and what to expect before, during, and after the role interview, so that you *do* know what you are getting into, and can speak decisively about your strength as a candidate. 

## Before the role interview

### Know the company that you're getting yourself into

Employers want to check that you understand the company and the industry, and not just at a basic level. Remember, it was already established in the phone interview that you know that Dunder Mifflin is a paper company and not a dog food company.

The objective of the role interview is to take this information and ask, "So what?" In this example, Dunder Mifflin is a paper company, which means it relies on a recurring stream of orders from large clients. In fact, one key client, such as the white pages or the county, can effectively double the company's growth. So, an incoming data scientist might want to know about topics like churn and customer lifetime value to optimize the firm's profitability. 

This is a sophisticated answer that took some assumptions and guesswork. It might turn out that Dunder Mifflin's data science team is currently entirely focused on optimizing delivery routes. But, you have told a story about how data science can add value to the organization. Add that to explaining how *you* can add value (which you'll go over in following sections), and you're becoming a serious candidate! 

**Learning about a company and industry**
Below are some ways to get the inside scoop on a company. Take this information further than just memorizing it. Ask yourself, "How does knowing this impact how I would do data science at this company? What problems am I seeing that I could answer as a data scientist?"  


- **Key people.** This starts with your hiring manager and coworkers and moves up to executives. What is their background? What interests them professionally? Conducting this research will vary based on the organization's size: startups might have so few employees that everyone is listed on the company's website, and there is very little hierarchy. For a larger organization, you might need to do some LinkedIn keyword research; for example, searching for "Data Science Manager" at "Company Name" to get a sense of key people in your future role. 
- **Google News.** Have company and industry news come to your inbox regularly by setting up a [Google News alert](https://news.google.com/?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en).

- **Social media.** This is a great way to see how the company presents itself. Which platforms is it active on, and why? How often are its social media profiles  updated, and with what kind of content? What is the overall tone and voice the company uses when interacting with customers? 

- **Newsroom and investor relations.**  Check the company's website as a whole to learn about things like its history and tone, but especially focus on its news page to learn about major updates. What are the big headlines in the company? What do these mean for business, and your job? 

    By law, publicly traded corporations must disclose certain financial documents, such as annual and quarterly financial reports. Of particular interest is form [8-K](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/8-k.asp), which corporations must file to disclose any information that might affect shareholders. This could be anything from the retirement of a key executive to a merger or acquisition.

    In addition to these mandated reports, publicly-traded corporations commonly hold conference calls and presentations with investment researchers and file news and reports for general shareholders. This information can provide a variety of perspectives for getting to know an organization.  

- **Mission, vision, and values.** Organizations issue mission, vision, and values statements to identify both for employees and customers what drives the organization and what principles it adheres to. Read these statements to get a sense of the organization's culture and its high-level goals and motivations. 

- **Glassdoor.**  This site provides a bank of interview questions, salaries, and reviews written by real employees, all of which provide an excellent insider's look at the organization. That being said, take this information with a grain of salt, as it is entirely self-reported, not validated, and likely not representative of a typical tenure at that organization. 

- **Analog communication.** Another way to get an insider's look at the organization is to talk to someone inside that organization. Do you share a personal connection or an alma mater with someone in a relevant position to your job search? There is nothing lost in attempting to contact them to learn more about the company's goals and culture. But be sensitive and courteous, as some companies might prefer that all communication with candidates be handled inside the formal process.

- **Industry research.**  It's also important to have a grasp of the industry landscape, and not only because this will give you a sense of the economics and competition that the organization follows. 
    
    You also need to quell any concerns stemming from so-called industry bias against data science; just because you are a trained data scientist, how does that make you a professional in this industry? Such concerns are more likely to come from professionals outside data science that are in established industries such as healthcare or manufacturing. 

    Fortunately, you know these concerns are unfounded, as you understand that domain expertise is an indispensable part of data science. Now, you just need to *prove* that you have this knowledge. You can get this knowledge from sources like the ones below:
    
    - **Industry trade associations.** Are there any professional designations or memberships in this industry? Who issues them? Look up these associations and check out their public resources. 
    - **Industry press.** What is the trusted source for industry news? This resource might be put out by a trade association itself or might come from an outside publisher. Peruse its website, social media accounts, and other information sources you can find to get a sense of the big names and issues in the industry. 
    - **Market research reports and white papers**. Research reports provide a strategic look at the industry at a high level. Use them to consider what the major opportunities and threats are to the industry. Is it a growing, stable, or declining industry? What should professionals expect in the next five to ten years?
    - **Social media.** Where do professionals gather digitally to learn and discuss this industry? Look for a LinkedIn group, or search for common hashtags. Perhaps there is a Twitter chat you could hop on to learn more, or there is an industry standard-bearer on Quora who helps people get started. 

- **Data science profession research.** Along with developing domain knowledge about the company and industry you are looking to join, it's a good idea to consider and strengthen your connection to the data science profession. What are your favorite places to learn about data science? Who do you enjoy following on Twitter? To perform your role well, you need to be an engaged professional, and having connections to the larger data science community will help. You should also adopt and be able to demonstrate a continuous learning mindset so that you've always got a plan for what you'd like to learn next, and know how it will benefit your career. Data science is a constantly evolving field, so employers want to know that you'll stay abreast of the changes.  

Congratulations on taking a company deep dive! You have gathered a respectable amount of research. Sharing the results of this research and asking for the manager's opinion and clarification can make for great interview discussion. 

Along with basic knowledge about the company and industry, you should also get a sense of major competitors, the overall industry landscape, and how the organization positions itself strategically. From this information, you can make educated guesses about what drives this organization and what they are looking for in a data science candidate. Your next goal is to prepare the case that *you* are this candidate. 

## Matching your qualifications to the job
You could have an encyclopedic knowledge of a company and industry, but the company is not hiring a *Jeopardy!* contestant. They want a data scientist, which means that you must demonstrate whether you can leverage your professional skill set to the benefit of the organization. 

Remember, a hiring manager is looking for an employee to make their life easier. This means that you should be able to identify and prevent problems before they become full-blown fires to battle or complete dead ends. As a data scientist, these problems could range from data collection, to model production, to getting buy-in from leadership. 

Enacting this change requires both a knowledge base as a data scientist and a broader sensibility as a professional. As you are in an early stage of your data science career, it will be important to show how this latter quality influences the former. 

**Mark up the job description** 
Load your job description into a word processor or print it. Now, go through it very carefully and very honestly. Read each qualification and responsibility. Do you meet the qualifications? Can you handle the job responsibilities?  Also, consider your personal interests: what areas are you perhaps not as experienced in that you would like to expand your knowledge of? Even better, what areas are you interested in where you've already proven your talents? 

If you feel exceptionally qualified for a certain qualification or responsibility, copy and paste it into a new file or spreadsheet and keep a running tab. Start looking for patterns in other job descriptions: what segments of what roles are you strongest in? From here, you can begin to triangulate your ideal role based on a bottom-up analysis of many roles. 

**Leverage old experience into directly transferable skills** 

An old saying goes, "Nobody gets fired for buying IBM." Coming from the IT world, this means that when making a purchase, it’s best to go with the safe, if unexciting bet over the unconventional, high-risk alternative. Maybe the IBM solution won't be as revolutionary and innovative as that of some scrappy startup, but it's probably not going to be a total letdown either, or go out of business due to insolvency.

You might think that your unique background is just the thing to shake things up in the company and provide an innovative perspective. The problem with framing your experience in this light is that hiring managers will see you as the risky choice, and they'd often rather go with the IBM-esque candidate who will be easier to explain to management. This means that you must frame your experience in a way that you *are* the IBM candidate: so reliable and experienced in the needs of the job that it's no stretch of the imagination to see you as the ideal data scientist for the role. 

To learn how to pivot your work outside work experience into the employer's requirements for a data scientist, you will work closely with a sample job description. 

**Explicitly link the employer's requirements to your experience**

The previous section encouraged you to fill out a table with areas of the job description in which you feel you are particularly qualified. Now it's time to add a column to this table: what specifically qualifies you for the job? 

Much of this experience is likely to come outside of your training as a data scientist. That's okay because it can establish you as an already-thriving professional who is beginning a new chapter as a data scientist rather than an entirely unknown quantity. 

For a demonstration of how to frame your experience in terms of an employer's requirements, see the examples below: 

| **Employer's requirements**                                                                                                       | **Your experience**                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Good oral and written communication skills                                                                                        | Maintained internal training guide at former role used to onboard over 200 associates                                                                                      |
| Motivation to develop deep product and business knowledge and to connect abstract modeling and analysis tasks with business value | Maintained $100,000 budget as president of student government, made investment decisions using investment metrics like internal rate of return and net present value       |
| A demonstrated capability for original research                                                                                   | Invited to International Sports Management Conference to present thesis on nautical flag signaling                                                                        |
| Experience programmatically structuring and cleaning data, and not just analyzing highly cleaned datasets                        | Merged unstructured data collected from scraping local news site with data collected from the National Weather Service's API to determine connection between weather and crime |

If a job requirement is strictly focused on being a professional data scientist, perhaps your only relevant experience is in your data science training. Don't discount this "amateur" experience! Again, if you had no basis for becoming a professional data scientist, you wouldn't have made it to the interview. Using your personal experience, which includes your data science training, tell the story to employers of what makes you the IBM of candidates. 

**See the data in everything**

That said, if data is really "the new oil," then it should be "powering" all professions, not just data science. With your data science training, revisit your work experience. Where were you working with data already? Start by listing previous accomplishments that you are particularly proud of in one column. In a second column, explain how each accomplishment can be seen as related to data science. You might surprise yourself with how much value you've already derived from data! Now, consider the value you can add with your recent training as a data scientist. 


| **Previously in my career, I…**                                                                                                       | **This has to do with data science because I…**                                                 |

### Prepare your questions 

Asking good questions is essential for any interview. In a role interview, your questions should show that you can go beyond raw duties and responsibilities and think strategically about how to deliver value in this role. This way, you are not just repeating questions that you asked earlier in the interview, or asking things that can be found with a web search. Questions like these might look like the ones below:

- "I saw one of your major competitors is being bought by Amazon. What do you think this will do to the competitive landscape of this industry?"
- "As you are a bank, I assume that one priority for your data science team is fraud detection. Do you use any unstructured data for these models?"
- "The job description mentions that this position will work with gathering data from the web using Python. What modules does your team use for this? I like using Scrapy because it is faster."

Write down a series of questions like the above and bring them with you to the interview. 

### Prepare your answers

Of course, the interviewer will have a lot of questions for you as well. Telling the story about how your background makes you the most suitable data scientist candidate can be delicate, so it's worth being specific about how you plan to answer specific answers, even to the point of writing them down.

That said, you'll want to not sound scripted during the interview, so make sure you can have these discussions naturally; perhaps by practicing with other students.

What you *can* have set and scripted are any assets you might like to show the interviewer. Maybe you have a question about a press release from the company, or you've written a blog post analyzing data that is relevant to the role. Print a couple of copies of this material (or more, if more people will be in the interview) and refer to it at relevant times in the interview. 

You shouldn't start the interview by passing around copies of your most sophisticated data science project to show how awesome you are. Instead, if you are asked to walk the interviewer through a particularly strong project you've performed, that's your cue to deliver what you've practiced. 

## During the role interview

### Be prepared but not scripted

The role interview might be the least structured interview format that is covered in this course. It will likely start with something like "Walk me through your resume or work experience," but after that will be a mix of specific questions about your background, along with more high-level questions about your work habits and preferences. 

You've brought plenty of reference material with you to this interview, from relevant research projects, to a line-by-line analysis of how your experience matches the employer's requirements, to questions about where your hiring manager prefers to get their industry news. 

Again, while it's smart to have this information printed and with you, let the interview unfold like a conversation. Just because you wrote questions down to help you prepare for an expected question, that doesn't mean you should actually read from that scripted answer during the interview. 

### Always be leveraging

As a new data scientist, perhaps your most important objective during a role interview is to communicate how your previous experience qualifies you for this new profession. 

You have already explicitly written down how this experience aligns with the role's requirements, and how you have previously worked with data to positive effect. From here, you can leverage any questions to fit the experience you have.

Is the employer asking if you have worked with Google Optimize? Talk about your training in A/B testing, and relate it to a time you learned a software product quickly to positive business effect. 

Is the employer asking if you have worked with difficult clients? Mention your time working with an irate customer who later wrote a thank-you note to your employer because of how you handled it. 

### Ask questions to go beyond the job description

At relevant times during the interview, ask questions you've prepared, or follow-up questions that came up in the course of discussion. Then touch base on any open points at the end of the interview. 

## After the role interview

### Plant your influence
If you brought any samples of your work that were relevant to the discussion, feel free to leave them with the interviewer if you have not presented them already. By leaving this material, you are planting your influence—it might not bloom into something fruitful, but is better than not planting it at all. 

### Thank yous always apply
Just as with any interview, it's common courtesy to send thank-you notes after an interview. See the [earlier module on phone screens](https://courses.thinkful.com/ds-phone-screen-v1/checkpoint/2) for tips on crafting a thank-you note. 

### Log your own records
Especially for a first-time job search, it's not uncommon to receive plenty of in-person interviews but not get any offers. If this is you, it's more good than bad news! You have what it takes to be seriously considered as a data scientist, or else the company wouldn't have used such considerable resources to interview you.

So, consider each time you interview as an opportunity to gather data. Note any questions you remember, what work projects seemed particularly well-received, and any other information that might help you in future interviews.

If you were not selected for a position, you might even consider asking for feedback. If you do ask, make sure you do really want to hear it, because unflattering feedback after being rejected for a position can feel like being kicked while you are down. Keep in mind that employers are by no means obligated to give feedback, and in fact, might have many reasons not to-from legal risk, to not having the time, to not enjoying having a difficult conversation themselves. 

If the employer does give you the opportunity to ask for feedback, again consider yourself as a data scientist, gathering data that you will use to benefit from in your journey. This detached status can help take some of the sting away from hearing difficult feedback about your experience and your interview performance. Be grateful, not defensive, and don't try to change anyone's mind. 

## Assignment
Now, it's your turn. Take the job descriptions that you gathered from the last checkpoint. Highlight and annotate the description to indicate which portions of the job description you're particularly suited for, and which you are most interested in. Also, consider conducting in-depth research on these companies and their industry using the methods outlined above. 

Use a copy of [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NaNrl-6ilox_uH8MSrNza6n7r3O10KybBFroyXja93k/edit?usp=sharing) to match your qualifications to employers' requirements, and consider how you have used data previously as a professional. The document also contains some questions to help you determine your competitive difference as a data science candidate. 

Submit your completed copy of the document for this assignment.
