Previously, you've been challenged to look into a dataset to ask and answer a series of questions. You are now ready for the next step in that process.

As usual, you'll start by picking a dataset. It can be the same dataset as a previous challenge or capstone, but make sure to use a dataset that makes sense for this task—so read all of the instructions before getting started.

Next, dive in and explore the dataset. Include your code and visuals from this process in your final write-up. While you're doing this, look for something that provokes a question—specifically one that can be answered with an experiment.

The main component of this capstone is a research proposal. Using the dataset that you selected, propose and outline an experiment plan. The plan should consist of three key components:

* Analysis that highlights your experimental hypothesis
* A rollout plan showing how you would implement and roll out the experiment
* An evaluation plan showing what constitutes success in this experiment

Your experiment should be as real as possible. Though you obviously will not have access to the full production environment to deploy your experiment, it should be feasible and interesting to the parties involved with your actual data source.

Aim to write a research proposal that is 3-5 pages long.

When you're done with this project, submit a link to your work below so the Thinkful team can review it. If changes are required, they'll let you know, and you'll have a chance to revise. When they're satisfied with your project, they'll approve the next goal in your dashboard (which is to get approval for your second capstone). Follow up with your mentor if you have questions and to ensure that the goal is marked as complete.

Good luck!
