This is it. You've reached the end. It's time for one more capstone to really show off everything that you've learned over the program. Use this as a chance to review the work that you've done so far and push it forward to new levels of relevance and technical achievement. Good luck.

For this capstone, you will extend on the work that you pursued in your specialization: you'll go out and build a model. However, this cannot be just any model. It has to be something that could be classified as a *data science product*. What does that mean?

A data science product is more than just a model. It is a solution. Your final capstone should solve a real problem and create something of value. It should be a product that you would argue for launching or implementing in production.

Great examples of data science products include Netflix's recommendation engine, Zillow's Zestimate tool, or Kayak's When to Buy index. All of these tools use data science to solve a real problem, offering value to users by filling a need. Counterexamples include a program that autonomously beats Super Mario levels or a model that identifies images of cats. A production-quality mobile app that [uses edge computing to identify hot dogs](https://medium.com/@timanglade/how-hbos-silicon-valley-built-not-hotdog-with-mobile-tensorflow-keras-react-native-ef03260747f3) in real time on commodity mobile hardware, however, gets close.

As such, this final model has to work, and work well. Spend time tuning it and optimizing it to be the best model that you can possibly make. If you do it well, you may even have a startup on your hands.

Before you get started, however, there are a few deliverables, requirements, and guidelines.

## Deliverables

* A one-page proposal, to be approved by Thinkful's data science team before you begin building your model
* A Jupyter Notebook that builds the model and shows your machine-learning tuning process
* A 20-minute presentation on your product. In this presentation, you should argue for your product's relevance, justify why this implementation is best, and describe the technical tools that you will use to get there. This presentation should include a demo!

After you create those deliverables and complete this module, you'll also do the following:

* Have a final 60-minute mock interview in which you'll defend your final capstone project.
* Present your capstone (using the presentation deliverable) to fellow data science students and mentors, and take questions from the audience.

## Requirements

You must use what you've learned from at least one specialization: time series, natural language processing, big data, or deep learning. And you are strongly encouraged to include both supervised and unsupervised techniques. 

## Guidelines

* Your dataset will be hugely important here. You've relied on preaggregated data before. But for this assignment, gathering your own data through scraping or other techniques may allow you to make a more impactful or novel product. It will likely need to see a continuous flow of data in order to be relevant as a data solution.
* Emphasize why your implementation is the _best_ implementation, not just _an_ implementation
* Remember, a good product is more than just metrics. It solves a problem.
* You do not have to make a frontend or a user interface for this product.

Each of the deliverables has a separate assignment below to submit, as well as more detailed instructions.
