Your LinkedIn profile is an online version of your resume. It’s better designed, follows a standardized format, and doesn’t have the rigid space restrictions of a resume, but the purpose of your LinkedIn profile is the same: to convert applications into phone screens. A well-crafted LinkedIn profile makes it easy for a company to invest more time in you as an applicant, and if you do a particularly good job, you may find it even drives recruiters to reach out to you directly. Additionally, complete profiles are [40x more likely to receive opportunities](https://university.linkedin.com/content/dam/university/global/en_US/site/pdf/TipSheet_NetworkingonLinkedIn.pdf).

Let’s break your profile down into sections and then tackle each one.


## Basic Info

The top of your profile contains a summary of your info including your name, title, location, and education. The element that you have the most control over is your title. You aren’t required to use the title of your current job. In fact, you want to choose a title that matches the job you want, rather than the job you have. Be as specific as possible without being so specific that you miss out on opportunities you’re interested in. Some suggestions include:

- Data Scientist
- Data Analyst
- Data Engineer
- Data Enthusiast


## Photo

Yes, your photo matters. It’s worth having a professional quality photograph here that you can reuse elsewhere (like your GitHub profile, AngelList profile, even your portfolio site), so look into and consider professional photographers if you don’t have a high-quality, recent photo on hand. Keep in mind that a good photo involves a few factors (e.g., well lit, not pixelated, you’re smiling).

For more details and advice, you can read these [guidelines directly from LinkedIn](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/2014/12/5-tips-for-picking-the-right-linkedin-profile-picture) or watch this video [“How to take a great profile photo”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSmXZOyff4U) (YouTube).

## Contact Info

This section is easy to overlook and many people only include their email address. Be sure to take advantage and include a link to your portfolio site, your GitHub profile, and any other social accounts you’d like companies to see. If you’re linking to something from your portfolio or resume, it probably belongs here too.

## About (Summary)

Your summary is where you’ll have the most control over how you position yourself and how a user thinks about you. Are you the former math teacher, or are you a Data Scientist with a background in Mathematics?This is your chance to control your story.

Hopefully, you have a well-crafted summary section on your resume to use as a starting point. This section should:

- Position you for the job you want, not the job you have
- Summarize your skills and your particular expertise
- Make it crystal clear exactly how you will add value to a company
- Include key language that screams “Data Scientist”
- Present you as a fun person who’s easy to get along with and works well on a team
- Communicate your personality and interests so the user remembers who you are
- Mentions of recent impressive projects/links to check out for more info 

You have a bit more room here than on your resume, but you still can’t afford to waste space or lose someone’s attention. Start it off by it being short, sweet, and concise, in case folks don’t read past the first sentence. However, from there, feel free to add more of a personal touch so those who do read, get a real sense of what you’re all about!

Here’s an example:
**Data Scientist  with experience using Python, SQL, and Excel. Also experienced in business intelligence, data modeling, and report design on the SAP HANA platform.**

[If they click on read more…]

**My name is [XXXX] and I tend to flex my right-brain muscles more often than not. In the fifth grade, I took a bunch of old women's magazines, clipped them up and created a student newsletter because our class didn't have one. It was poorly constructed, stapled together on wide-ruled loose-leaf notebook paper, but it became super popular; so much so that other students in my class started creating their own zines to compete with me. My fifth-grade teacher was astonished by the engagement and told me that I was an "innovative" 10-year-old that should hold on tight to her creative skills. She also let me skip gym class so that I could start producing the class newsletter with Microsoft Word. Shout out to ClipArt.**

**Fast forward several years and I am still on a mission to create bigger, better (and more useful) things. Over the past five years, I've learned to code, launched an online magazine that received funding from angel investors, and enhanced my digital marketing toolbox. Some might say that I just like to keep myself busy; I say that there's a method to the madness.**

**Connect with me if your girl power is on fleek, you want to diversify the tech industry, or you're interested in building awesome and impactful partnerships that produce measurable results.**

**Specialties: data mining, data analysis, data cleaning, growth hacking, blogging, Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, research, modeling, machine learning, solving puzzles and a love for all things AI.** 


## Experience

Your LinkedIn Experience section should mirror the experience section on your resume.

While you need to manually write in your job title, company name, and location, and select your start and end dates, it’s best to copy and paste the bulleted accomplishments on your resume for that job. LinkedIn doesn’t have formatting options, so you can use hyphens (`-`) or dots (`•`) for bullets. When you finish adding entries, cross-reference them with the entries on your resume to ensure that they match. 

It’s true that you have more space on your LinkedIn profile than on your resume, but that doesn’t mean that an employer’s attention is infinite. Resist the temptation to overload your profile with unnecessary details or jobs that you had more than a decade ago. If you do choose to add more detail to your LinkedIn profile, it should be by adding accomplishments that are _relevant_ to the job that you want but didn’t have room for on your 1-page resume. 


## Education 

Like your Experience section, your LinkedIn Education section should match the education entries on your resume. 


## Including Thinkful in your LinkedIn profile

You should list your Thinkful experience in either the Experience or Education section of your profile—not both. Below are best practices for listing it in either section.


### Including Thinkful in the Experience section of your LinkedIn profile

On LinkedIn, you’re unable to reorder your sections and projects are not prominently displayed. For this reason, it can be helpful to list your Thinkful experience in the Experience section of your LinkedIn profile. 

For your title, write the title of the program that you're in or that you're still in training; for example, “Data Science Program” or “Data Scientist in Training.” Leave the employment type blank (or "-"). And write "Thinkful" as the company name. 

Then, in the description of your Thinkful Experience entry, add the details of your projects, making sure that you list all of the skills and tools that you used. When it makes sense, you should also utilize the media function that allows you to upload an image of or add a link to your Experience entry. 


### Including Thinkful in the Education section of your LinkedIn profile

If you include Thinkful in the Education section of your LinkedIn profile, type “Thinkful” for the school, “Certificate” for the degree, and the title of your program for the Field of Study. For example, “Data Science.”
  
You can leave the description blank or list the skills and tools that you learned during your program. Don’t include the word “bootcamp” in your description, as some employers have a bias against bootcamp grads. 


## Projects

If you did not include your capstone projects in the Experience section, you can add a Projects section to display the projects you’re proud of. Adding these helps position you as a Data Scientist. You should be able to take the descriptions directly from your GitHub, portfolio site, resume, or Angel List profile.

Which projects should you include and which should you exclude? As a general rule, you should include 2-5 projects, depending on what you’re most proud of and the skills you want to communicate. Do not include any cookie-cutter or tutorial projects, or any projects that would make you look like a beginner. Professional quality work only.


## Skills

Recruiters generally don’t pay much attention to the skills section. They know most of the endorsements are from our friends or people we’ve traded endorsements with. However, to rank higher in LinkedIn searches and against other candidates using the LinkedIn job search feature, you need to add as many skills as possible (the max allowed is 50).


- Remove irrelevant skills that don’t speak to the career you’re transitioning into (think Microsoft Word, Baking, Filing) and outdated skills (think ActionScript, Visual Basic).
- Add relevant skills so that you can rank higher in recruiter searches. 
- Re-order your skills to place the most relevant ones (Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Statistics, etc) at the top.

There’s some debate on whether or not skill endorsements are useful, but at a glance it makes you seem more credible, so connect with as many students and grads from Thinkful/Bloc that you can find. Once your new contact accepts your connection request, immediately go and endorse their skills. Usually, they will reciprocate the favor. 


## Recommendations

As a career changer, having someone vouch for you is incredibly valuable. In order to graduate, your mentor needs to endorse you to demonstrate that you're ready to be a solid contributor to an engineering team. If your mentor is on LinkedIn, ask if they’ll write a recommendation for you and be sure to return the favor. 

Similarly, if there is anyone you’ve collaborated on a project with or who can speak to your professional skills, ask them if they’d consider recommending you publicly.


## Connections

The more connections you have, the easier it is for you to get introductions into a company and the easier it is for recruiters and hiring managers to find your profile. Reach out to connect with former and current colleagues, other people you've met in the Thinkful community, and classmates from undergrad. As you’re making additional connections on LinkedIn, endorse people for the skills you know they have and ask if they’d be willing to return the favor.

Then, see who LinkedIn suggests you connect with. Go to www.linkedin.com and look to the top right for a “People you may know” element. If you don’t see that element, you may need to click through and clear the notifications there first. Check out [this video from LinkedIn on how to make connections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbnpqD_9srM) (YouTube).


## How to Attract Recruiters

In addition to all of the above, there is a setting that actually alerts recruiters that you are open to opportunities. Watch “[How to Indicate to Recruiters You Are Open to New Opportunities on LinkedIn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7HxSnqUF6U)” (YouTube).
