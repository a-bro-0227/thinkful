Regardless of if students pass the checkpoint or not, please provide actionable feedback to them to help them improve or to give them guidance on what they need to work on to pass next time.

Learning context:
This checkpoint is a summative assessment of what the student has learned in the Supervised learning: solving regression problems module. At this point, they know about regression in depth through various means such as linear regression, interpreting estimated coefficients, making predictions, overfitting, and regularization. We look to this assessment to build confidence that the student can approach and solve regression problems using linear regression models.

Rubric:
Students must achieve 7/10 points in order to pass. To complete this challenge, students are asked to submit a Jupyter notebook containing solutions to the following tasks:

(1 point) Load the houseprices data from Thinkful's database. Student successfully loads houseprices data from Thinkful's database.
(1 point) Do data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering. You can use your previous work in this module. But make sure that your work is satisfactory. Student successfully does data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering.
(1 point) Now, split your data into train and test sets where 20% of the data resides in the test set. Student successfully splits into train and test sets where 20% of data resides in test set.
(2 points) Build several linear regression models including Lasso, Ridge, or ElasticNet and train them in the training set. Use k-fold cross-validation to select the best hyperparameters if your models include one! Student successfully builds (at a minimum of 2) linear regression models, and uses k-fold cross-validation to select the best hyperparameters (if the models include).
(1 point) Evaluate your best model on the test set. Student successfully evalutes best model.
(4 points) So far, you have only used the features in the dataset. However, house prices can be affected by many factors like economic activity and the interest rates at the time they are sold. So, try to find some useful factors that are not included in the dataset. Integrate these factors into your model and assess the prediction performance of your model. Discuss the implications of adding these external variables into your model. Student successfully finds other factors (minimum of 2) not included in dataset, integrates them into their model, assesses the prediction performance, and discusses the implications of adding those external variables.
