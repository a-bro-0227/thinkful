You know how to ingest and explore data in pandas. Now, you're ready to learn how to conduct basic data analysis in pandas. Pandas has several built-in methods for generating descriptive statistics from DataFrames.

Many of these methods work on a *Series*, which is a single column in a DataFrame. In this checkpoint, you will examine how to use some of the most useful of these methods.
