Regardless of if students pass the checkpoint or not, please provide actionable feedback to them to help them improve or to give them guidance on what they need to work on to pass next time.


For this assignment, the student is asked to load houseprices data from CSV into a dataframe and then track down some basic info from the dataset.  They are asked to produce a notebook that answers each of the questions below, with an individual cell addressed at each question.
When grading this assignment, your focus should be on functionality over style. The basic question is, does the student produce code that answers the questions?

To pass this checkpoint, the answer to that question should be "Yes" for 8 of the 10 questions.

Styling problems should also be something you should make note of in your feedback.

Answer the following questions:

>How many rows of data does the table contain?
>Are there any nulls in any columns?
>How many distinct values are there in the mszoning column?
>How many distinct values are there in the street column?
>Describe the range of the saleprice.
>Describe the range of the lotarea.
>Is there a statistically significant difference between the prices of houses that have an open porch versus houses that do not have an open porch? 
>How did you handle null values? Hint: use the variable openporchsf. You will need to transform this variable so that it can be used in a t-test.
>Is there a significant correlation between the lotarea and saleprice variables? 
>Are they positively or negatively correlated?
