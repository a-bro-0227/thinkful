Your mock interview will be based on one of three real-life postings for data science job positions that you will explore in the next three checkpoints. These jobs come from the industries listed below:

        1. High-growth tech startup
        2. Blue-chip chemical and manufacturing corporation
        3. Nonprofit teaching hospital

Prepare for a mock phone screen using the steps outlined in the previous checkpoint. The interview is simulated in that you did not choose to apply for the position. While you might not be interested in working for the company or industry, the requirements of each posting overlaps with the training you will receive in this program. Thus, the position should interest you at some level as a data scientist.  

Each phone screen includes four questions and should last 10 to 15 minutes. 

At the beginning of this module, you scheduled a mock "phone" screen over video with an educator. This mock interview is not graded pass or fail, like all of the future mock interviews that you will encounter. However, you will still receive detailed feedback, and it is required that you participate in the interview to complete the course.
