With your research proposal in hand, it's time to conduct the analysis in Jupyter. Provide a complete research report using the framework introduced in the previous module. The report should tell the story to your intended audience and should include compelling visualizations and actionable insights. Walk through the analysis using clean, reproducible code. Include plenty of notes and comments to guide others through your thinking. 

Along the way, consider issues in the experiment design. What bias might be influencing the analysis? Can you test for it? If you could collect new data in this domain, what changes would you make in the data collection process? What other variables or samples might be useful to test? 

When you're done, save a copy of your report somewhere publicly accessible on the web. Then, submit a link below. You'll receive feedback from a member of the Thinkful team.
