This module teaches the basics of working with the command line, Git, and GitHub.

The *command line* is a text-based environment where you can do things like create, move, copy, and delete files and folders, using different commands that are like mini-programs.

*Git* is the most popular *version control system* in use today. A version control system is used to keep track of changes in files within a project. It allows you to take snapshots of a project at different points in time and create different versions of a project. You can then use Git to move between and even combine those different versions.

Git on its own is useful. But if you want to work from multiple computers or collaborate with other programmers, simply saving snapshots of your code on your local machine isn't enough. That's where *GitHub* comes in. GitHub is a service that allows you to save and share Git *repositories* (that is, projects where you've activated Git for version control) in the cloud. GitHub allows you and others to pull down code for a project from a central location, make changes locally, and then push your changes back up to GitHub. Then, on GitHub, you can manage *pull requests*, which are requests to merge a set of changes into an existing codebase. Note that there are other cloud-based Git services (such as [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)), but Thinkful teaches GitHub because it is the most widely used.

By the end of this module, you'll feel comfortable doing the most common sorts of things that data scientists and programmers use the command line for. You'll have a solid understanding of Git and GitHub, and you'll know how to use them to back up work, collaborate, and keep track of changes across your files.
