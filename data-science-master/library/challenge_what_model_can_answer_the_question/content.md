You now have a fairly substantial starting toolbox of supervised learning methods that you can use to tackle a host of exciting problems. To make sure that all of these ideas are organized in your mind, go through the list of problems below. For each, identify which supervised learning method (or methods) would be best for addressing that particular problem. Explain your reasoning.

 1. Using data from the last 20 Olympics, predict the running times of prospective Olympic sprinters.
 2. You have more features (columns) than rows in your dataset.
 3. Identify the most important characteristic for predicting the likelihood of being jailed before age 20.
 4. Implement a filter to highlight emails that might be important to the recipient.
 5. You have more than 1,000 features.
 6. Predict whether someone who adds items to their cart on a website will purchase the items.
 7. Your dataset dimensions are 982400x500.
 8. Identify faces in an image.
 9. Predict which of three flavors of ice cream will be most popular with boys versus girls.
