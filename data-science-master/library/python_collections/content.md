So far, all of the things that you've stored in a variable have been a single value, such as a string (like a name) or an integer (like a score). But you'll often want to collect several such values together into a single variable. Python has several great built-in data structures for doing that.

In this checkpoint, you'll get a brief intro to the two most commonly used data structures: *lists* and *dictionaries*. Later in this module, you'll dig deeper into both of these.

The rest of this checkpoint contains a combination of text and working code examples that will load in an embedded Jupyter Notebook below.

<jupyter notebook-name="collections" course-code="DSBC"></jupyter>

Check out the two videos below for screencast demonstrations of the topics covered in this checkpoint.

**Note:** You may see references in the videos suggesting that dictionaries are *unordered*. Please ignore this; this is no longer the case with newer versions of Python.
