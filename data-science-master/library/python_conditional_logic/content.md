In this checkpoint, you'll learn about three related topics: *logic*, *control flow*, and *conditionals*. Together, these tools will allow you to use Python to write programs that can behave differently depending on their inputs.

Take parsing strings as an example. You might write a function that extracts a zip code from a string and stores the result somewhere. When your program runs it, it may run into a situation where it's unable to find a zip code in the string that you're parsing. When that happens, you want the ability to programmatically say, "If such and such is the case, do this. Otherwise, do that." That's what you'll learn in this checkpoint.

Here's what you'll cover:

* **Boolean values:** `True` and `False`
* **Logical operators:** `and` and `or`
* **Control flow:** This refers to the tools provided by a programming language to conditionally determine which set of instructions runs. You'll cover `if` / `elif` / `else` and `try` / `except` blocks, which are two forms of control flow in Python.

This checkpoint ends with a set of drills where you can practice these new concepts.

Before digging in, it's a good idea to print out this [Python-basics cheatsheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DQB4MgzfPYI90e6xqSQnifo0KV0dni9cK-N4wRe9CX0/edit?usp=sharing). Keep it handy as you're learning the basics of Python. It contains common commands that you'll want to be familiar with.
