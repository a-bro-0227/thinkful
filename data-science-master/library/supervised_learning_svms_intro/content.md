In this module, you'll learn about a powerful classifier and regression technique: the support vector machine (SVM). You'll explore the original classifier implementation, and you'll learn how that can be transformed to create a similar model for regression. Here's what you'll learn about:

 * Support vectors for classification and regression
 * Kernels and the kernel trick
 * Useful extensions of SVM

Support vector machines embody a set of common techniques that will be an essential part of your data science toolbox. Continue on to get started!
