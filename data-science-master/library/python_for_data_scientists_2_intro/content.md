In the previous module, you learned programming fundamentals in Python. In this module, you'll learn how to get your hands on some common types of data in your Python code. You'll explore how to work with the following data sources in Python:

- Web-based data APIs
- Web pages (via web scraping)

This will expand the data sources that you have at your disposal as a data scientist. Then, in the final two Python modules, you'll explore how to conduct data analysis in Python.

For a further overview of the data sources that you'll learn to manipulate in this module, check out the video below.
