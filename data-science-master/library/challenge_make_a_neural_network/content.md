For this challenge, you have two options for using neural networks. Choose one of the following:

 * __Use RBM to perform feature extraction on an image-based dataset that you find or create__. If you go this route, present the features that you extract and explain why this is a useful feature-extraction method in the context that you're operating in. Do *not* use the [*MNIST digit recognition* database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) or the [*iris* dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). These have both been worked on frequently in very public ways, and the code is easily available. However, that code could be a useful resource to refer to.
 
 _Or_

 * __Create a multilayer perceptron neural network model to predict on a labeled dataset of your choosing__. Compare this model to either a boosted tree or a random forest model, and describe the relative tradeoffs between complexity and accuracy. Make sure to vary the hyperparameters of your MLP!

Once you've chosen which option you prefer, get to modeling and submit your work below.
