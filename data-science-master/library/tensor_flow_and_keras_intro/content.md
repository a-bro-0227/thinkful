So, you've chosen TensorFlow and Keras. Those previous neural network lessons just weren't enough for you, huh? Maybe they whetted your appetite for just a bit more? Maybe you came into this program wanting to learn these tools? Maybe deep learning could be a deep-rooted interest?

Whatever your reasons, here you are. And now, you will dive a little deeper into these topics. As mentioned before, this is going to just scratch the surface of TensorFlow and Keras. Rather than exploring theory, this module will focus on some of the most powerful tools available to implement neural networks. Note, however, that to understand these tools, you will also need to learn more about neural networks as a concept.

So what are you waiting for? Continue on to get started!
