Data science is a multidisciplinary field; accordingly, the data science interview process involves a variety of job interviews, each evaluating specific aptitudes of the data science candidate. Data science is a field that's highly rigorous *and* business-facing, so interviews examine a candidate's skills as both a technician and a practitioner. 

## Speaking the data lingo

In the previous checkpoint, you were encouraged to begin following influential data scientists on Twitter and to become active in your local data science community. This immersion can provide many benefits, including teaching you the lingo of the data science community and deepening your understanding of what it means to be a data scientist.

As a data scientist candidate, you're not only learning the skills that a data scientist needs to be successful. You're also learning how to market those skills to employers. Sales cliches like "know your customer's pain points" and "sell on benefits, not features" also apply to promoting yourself for a job. You want to convey that you know what you're getting into as a new data scientist. You're totally okay with spending the majority of your waking hours as a "data janitor"—heck, you're excited about it! Although you'll need guidance and supervision, you do want to show that you are someone who is going to take the initiative to make things happen. Your goal is to signal that you can work on a team, you're easy to teach, and you intuitively "get" what data scientists are doing. 

Expressing these traits isn't just about know-how. It's also about having the right attitude and having your finger on the pulse of the data science field, which you can get from your involvement in the community. Technical chops are necessary but not sufficient: you can be a machine-learning whiz and still be an undesirable potential employee. That said, technical chops are necessary! Even the most eager candidate in history won't get far as a prospective data scientist if they can't express some track record of proven data science work. 

The goal of these interviews is to assess that you have both the right acumen and the right attitude to be a successful data scientist. Now you will learn about the three typical data science interview types: behavioral, role, and technical. Over the course of the program, you will have mock interviews for each of these types of interviews.


## Behavioral or background interviews

In a behavioral interview, you will be asked to describe past behavior. Interviewers use these interviews to evaluate how you behave in work settings, how you work in a team, and whether you are a good fit for the department and the company.

Rather than ask speculative questions, like how you might deal with a hypothetical scenario, the interviewer will ask you to reflect on a real-life past event. These behavioral questions could be based on your performance in previous data science projects. Or they may focus on more general events, such as a time when you worked on a team with personality conflicts, delivered on a project with a tight deadline, or came up with a creative idea. 


## Role interviews

Role interviews are used to assess your technical aptitude as a data scientist. The interviewer wants to see what raw abilities you would bring to the job on day one. These may be mental math or brainteaser questions, or they could be more theoretical questions about statistics and machine learning. They could also be related to coding or the company's industry. Data science draws from many disciplines—so, as a data science candidate, you need to be prepared to speak intelligently about a large body of knowledge.  


## Technical or whiteboard interviews

In a technical or whiteboard interview, you will be asked to produce a coding script on a whiteboard. This is done to see how you walk through and evaluate a data project under tight constraints. The interviewer wants to see your approach in learning about, stepping through, testing, and documenting a script. 

## Assignment
There is no assignment for this checkpoint. Instead, you will conduct mock behavioral, role, and technical interviews later in the program.
