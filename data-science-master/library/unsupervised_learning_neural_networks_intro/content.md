Neural networks constitute one of the most popular and impactful branches of machine learning today. This is the very bleeding edge of data science, but it has historical roots. In this module, you'll explore the following:

- The perceptron model
- Multilevel perceptrons and neural network structure
- How to use neural networks for supervised and unsupervised learning

These are the basic concepts behind neural networks. Although you'll focus on these introductory concepts in this module, along the way, you'll also learn about resources where you can explore these ideas more deeply.
