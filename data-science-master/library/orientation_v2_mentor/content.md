Your mentor is one of the most important people supporting you in this course. Mentors are experienced professionals who can give you the inside scoop about what it’s really like to work as a data scientist, what skills you will need, what mistakes to avoid, and how to set yourself up for success. Most people who are learning to be a data scientist don’t have this valuable resource so it’s important to utilize your mentor’s time wisely. 

Here are some tips to help you get the most out of your mentoring relationship: 

## Availability

One of the first things that you did as a student was set your availability for mentor sessions. This allows available mentors to be matched with you. It’s also something that you can update at any time. To do this, log in to your profile and go to Settings. There you will see “Availability.” Highlight every hour that you are available. The more availability you have, the easier it is to be paired with a mentor quickly. If you have minimal availability, it might take a bit longer to get paired with a mentor as you’ll have fewer choices available to you.

## What to expect in your 1-on-1 mentor sessions

Mentor sessions are your chance to get the undivided support of an industry veteran who is invested in your success. You’ll get the best results from your sessions if you come prepared. We encourage students to use this time to ask questions about the curriculum and discuss any problems that came up working on your projects. In your first session with a new mentor, you should discuss your goals and learning strategies. How you would like your session to flow? Do you want your mentor to push you hard or to be your cheerleader? 

Sessions may also include a review of your work. Be sure to come to your session prepared to talk about what you’ve been working on and what you’d like to accomplish in the next few days.

Also, know that mentors love feedback. If there's something your mentor does that is particularly useful, let them know. If there's something that feels less productive, tell them that as well. Each student wants something slightly different from their mentor. By being communicative, you can continually shape your time together so that it's most productive for you. 

## Attend all your sessions

It probably goes without saying that to succeed in this course, you’ll need to work hard between sessions. That said, life happens, and sometimes that means that you can’t get your work done before a scheduled session. But go anyway! 

1-on-1 sessions can be productive even if you don’t complete your work. It would be most helpful if you have your work completed before each session; however, there are other ways your mentor can help you if you did not. You and your mentor might pair on your current project, or your mentor might walk you through some relevant examples. This might also be a good time to strategize about industries, jobs, and cities you should target. In short, there’s plenty to discuss even if you don’t have work to review. You will be glad that you did. Remember, mentors are not only there to teach you, but to encourage you and cheer you on! 

Your mentor is also there to help you to develop problem-solving skills and flex new muscles to think like a data scientist. One of the ways we encourage our students to train themselves to try their hardest to solve problems on their own and by utilizing our other support resources like Technical Coaches and Group Sessions before taking it to the mentor. 

### If you must miss a session, let your mentor know ahead of time.

Try never to miss a session. But if something comes up, be a professional: notify your mentor in advance, ideally at least 24 hours beforehand. If you don't inform your mentor 24 hours in advance, your session will be forfeited. If you do give advance notice, your mentor may be able to reschedule your session or you can request a pause for the time you will miss.

If things aren’t working out, let us know sooner rather than later. We do our best to pair you with a mentor that we believe will be a good match, but if for any reason you feel like things aren’t working out, let us know ASAP by reaching out to your academic success manager so we can fix things.

Remember, learning is a two-way street! Your mentor is eager to guide you through the learning process but your success depends on you. So be ready to show up, be prepared, and work hard!
