You've created your model and a Jupyter Notebook that presents your findings. Next up, you'll discuss your final project in a 1-on-1 interview with an evaluator. Then you'll present your final project to the Thinkful data science community.

You'll schedule both of these events from your dashboard after completing this module. In this checkpoint, you'll go through some guidance on how to prepare for both.

## Preparing for your final project interview

This 60-minute, 1-on-1 interview focuses on your final capstone project. The interviewer will ask about what you did and the techniques that you used to do it.

Be prepared to talk about the following:

- Your end user and the value that your project provides to them
- The technical ins and outs of your model
- How you evaluated the performance of your final model and alternative models you considered
- Your data sources
- Next steps that you'd take to expand on your work


## Preparing for your final project presentation

You can think of this presentation in several different ways. For example, it could be like pitching your product to potential investors. Or it could be like pitching it to a relevant company while interviewing. The key is that this presentation should be engaging, informative, and beautifully put together. It should run approximately 20 minutes, and it should be technical but product focused. That means that although you should explain the machine learning that you used, focus more on explaining the product itself, what problem that it solves, and why your solution is valuable.
