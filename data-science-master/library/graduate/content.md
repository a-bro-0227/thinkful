Wow, well done! You've accomplished a lot over the past few months, and you should be proud of yourself.

Now, for the part that you've been waiting forâ€”finding a job as a data scientist!

To move on to the job search phase and officially graduate, email your academic success manager and confirm the following:
* You've completed all mock interviews for the program.
* Your capstones have received final approval.

Once your academic success manager has confirmed that you've met all graduation criteria, they will approve this goal on your dashboard and graduate you. Then they will send you an email containing a graduation survey and certificate of completion. Make sure to fill out the graduation survey as soon as possible to help your career coach understand where you are in your job search.

You will then officially move on to the job search phase, and a career coach will contact you to discuss the next steps.

While you're awaiting graduation approval and the introduction to your career coach, do the following:
* Review the modules in the *Careers* course
* Attend networking events
* Start applying for jobs!
