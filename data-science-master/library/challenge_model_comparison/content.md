You now know two kinds of regression and two kinds of classifiers. So now, you're ready to start using them to compare models!

Comparing models is something that data scientists do _all the time_. There's very rarely just one model that would be possible to run for a given situationâ€”so learning to choose the best one is very important.

In this checkpoint, you'll work on regression. Find a dataset and build a KNN regression and an OLS regression. Compare the two. How similar are they? Do they miss in different ways?

Create a Jupyter Notebook with your models. At the end, in a Markdown cell, write a few paragraphs to describe the models' behaviors and why you favor one model or the other. Try to determine whether there is a situation where you would change your mind, or whether one is unambiguously better than the other. Lastly, try to note what it is about the _data_ that causes the better model to outperform the weaker model. Submit a link to your Notebook below.
