A *dictionary* is a common and useful data structure that allows you to store data as an ordered collection of *key-value pairs*. (In older versions of Python, dictionaries were *unordered*â€”now you know!)

In this checkpoint, you'll learn about everything that you need to know to use Python dictionaries. This checkpoint ends with a set of drills in which you'll practice the concepts that you've learned here.
