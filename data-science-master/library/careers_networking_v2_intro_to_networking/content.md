## Learning objective

By the end of this checkpoint, you should be able to explain the purpose of networking.


## Overview


Networking has a bad reputation. It's often associated with name tags, forced conversation, and professionals maneuvering to advance their own careers. Thankfully, in reality, *networking* is just a jargony way to say *socializing*. Networking is simply making new friends and acquaintances and nurturing the relationships that you already have.

And networking is important, especially for people who are changing careers. Recent studies suggest that close to [70% of jobs are never advertised](https://www.businessinsider.com/at-least-70-of-jobs-are-not-even-listed-heres-how-to-up-your-chances-of-getting-a-great-new-gig-2017-4), and that you're [20 times more likely to be hired](https://thejobsauce.com/is-landing-a-job-really-about-who-you-know/) if you're referred for a job. In a recent survey sent to over 500 Thinkful alumni, grads reported that their top reasons for success during their job search were networking and cold outreach.

Networking not only increases your odds of finding and landing a job, it also allows employers to get to know you beyond your resume. And it helps you become a better candidate as you learn from other professionals in your desired industry. Plus, you might make a new friend. 

Like most things, networking comes in all shapes and sizes. This module introduces you to various networking approaches, so that you can find the ones that are right for you. You will learn to tell your story, leverage your current network, conduct informational interviews, and participate in industry-related events. You'll even learn some tips for shy networkers.
