Your mentor is your greatest ally in this program. They're there to help you learn data science concepts, teach you strategies for getting unstuck, give you feedback on your work, and provide you with firsthand knowledge of what it's like to work as a data scientist.

Here are some tips to help you get the most out of your mentoring relationship.

## What to expect in your 1-on-1 sessions

One-on-one sessions are your chance to get the undivided attention of a professional data scientist who is invested in your success. Use this time to ask questions about the course readings and examples and to discuss any problems that came up working on your projects.

Sessions may also include review of concepts from the curriculum, code, or presentations that you're working on. Be sure to come to your session prepared to discuss what you've been working on and what you'd like to accomplish in the next few days.

Also, know that mentors love feedback. If there's something your mentor does that is particularly useful, tell them that. If there's something that feels less productive, tell them that as well. Each student wants something slightly different from their mentor, so use the first few weeks to shape your time together so that it's as productive for you as possible.

## Attend your sessions even if you didn't complete your work

It probably goes without saying that in order to succeed in this program, you'll need to work hard between sessions. That said, life happens, and sometimes that means that you can't get your work done before a scheduled session.

If that happens, go to your session anyway. One-on-one sessions can be productive even if you don't complete your work. You and your mentor could pair on your current project, or your mentor could walk you through some relevant examples. This might also be a good time to strategize about industries, jobs, and cities that you should target. In short, there's plenty to discuss, even if you don't have work to review.

## If you must miss a session, let your mentor know ahead of time

Try to avoid missing any sessions. But if something comes up, be professional: notify your mentor in advance, ideally at least 24 hours beforehand. If you do miss a session, work with your mentor to schedule a makeup session. But recognize that sometimes a makeup session won't be possible, especially if your next scheduled session is coming up shortly after.

## If things aren't working out, let your ASM know sooner rather than later

The Thinkful team does their best to pair you with a mentor who they believe will be a good match. But if for any reason you feel like things aren't working out, reach out to your academic success manager (who you can find listed in [your dashboard](https://dashboard.thinkful.com/)) as soon as possible so that they can fix things.
