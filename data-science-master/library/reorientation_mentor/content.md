Your mentor is there to give you data science-specific guidance through your program. You will meet with them every week through video sessions at a designated URL. 

Your mentor is an experienced data scientist who can provide you with advice about what it’s like to be a professional data scientist. They help to unravel tricky concepts, hold you accountable to your goals, and talk you through imposter syndrome. You can find your mentor’s information at the top of your Overview dashboard.

#### Availability

One of the first things that you did when you enrolled in the immersive course was set your availability for mentor sessions. This allows available mentors to be matched with you. You can update your availability at any time in “Settings” in your account.


### What are good things to talk about in my mentor sessions?

In your first session with a new mentor, you should discuss your goals and learning strategies. How you would like your session to flow? Do you want your mentor to push you hard or to be your cheerleader? 

We encourage students to use time with their mentor to ask questions about the curriculum or class and discuss any problems that came up working on your assignments or projects. Sessions may also include a review of your work. Be sure to come to your session prepared to talk about what you’ve been working on and what you’d like to accomplish. You and your mentor might pair on your current project, or your mentor might walk you through some relevant examples. 

Mentors love feedback. If there's something your mentor does that is particularly useful, let them know. If there's something that feels less productive, tell them that as well. Each student wants something slightly different from their mentor. By being communicative, you can continually shape your time together so that it's most productive for you. 


### What if I have to miss a session?

If something comes up, notify your mentor in advance, ideally at least 24 hours beforehand. If you don't inform your mentor 24 hours in advance, your session will be forfeited. If you do give advance notice, your mentor may be able to reschedule your session for a time that works for both of you.

### What if my mentor and I aren’t the right fit (for any reason)?

If things aren’t working out, let your academic success manager know sooner rather than later! It is important for us to make sure that you are comfortable and that you feel you are accomplishing what goals you set for yourself during sessions with your mentor.
