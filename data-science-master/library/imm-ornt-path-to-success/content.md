This program requires a lot of discipline and diligence to stay on track. You'll
need to manage your time and goals to make sure you stay on schedule to complete
your program on time. All the requirements for completing your program are here
on the platform.

In this section, you'll learn about some resources and best practices to help
you stay on track. You'll also get familiar with the qualities that identify
successful students. Every student is different, so you'll need to figure out
the best strategies for your own needs and situation. The important thing is to
have strategies for tackling the work that your program requires.

## Putting in the time and managing it well

It's critical to make time for this program. You'll need to have a system for
managing your time and minimizing distractions. Students who are successful in
this program are the ones who use a calendar to track their time. They
consistently put in at least 40 hours a week (and often more). That means setting
aside time outside of class to study, complete homework, and do career prep. 
Successful students have strategies for how they will combat distraction and manage 
the other demands on their time. They are punctual to all of their mentor sessions, 
group sessions, and meetings with their academic success managers.

If you know that you struggle to manage your time, are often late and miss
deadlines, or if you have a lot of competing demands on your time, then you
should be proactive about figuring out strategies that will work for you. The
next checkpoint goes over some recommended strategies in more detail.

## Moving yourself forward

Problem-solving is a key skill for succeeding in this program and in your
selected industry. Rarely will there be a clear step-by-step process of what you
are supposed to do or why something isn't working. Often, you will have to
figure things out and feel (mostly) comfortable with not having things spelled
out.

As a student, you'll have a lot of chances to get comfortable with this feeling
and build your problem-solving muscles. You should focus on building key traits:
following through on things you start, getting better at finding resources and
answers on your own, and figuring out how to approach a problem even when the
instructions aren't totally clear.

Our programs are designed to help you build autonomy. The process of becoming
an autonomous problem-solver is challenging and uncomfortable for most students.
When you are just starting out, it's normal to want clear guidance and a lot of
hand-holding. Our programs are designed to support you as you learn but also
to push you to build the skill of finding solutions on your own.

There will be times when you just want someone to tell you the answer—but those
answers aren't going to come, and it's going to be frustrating. The moments when
you are frustrated are the moments when real learning happens—if you can stay
motivated and persevere through challenges.

One of the most important things that you should remember as you work toward
your new career path is that [confusion is your

not your enemy.

## Interpersonal skills

Communication is key to success in this program, on the job search, and in your 
new career. Communication, both technical and nontechnical, is very much a soft 
skill that should be practiced and improved. If you can't explain your perspective, 
if you don't listen well, or if you don't care about building relationships with 
others, then you are going to find your job search very difficult and keeping a job
even more difficult. Make sure to nurture this skill with the same dedication
that you put toward mastering the specific subject matter concepts within your 
program.

## Grit and resilience

The last piece of the puzzle for finding success in this program, this career,
and even in life is resilience.

This program is tough. Learning these skills is tough. If it were easy, everyone
would do it. But don't let that scare you or make you believe that this is an
impossible task. It's definitely possible, and regular people can do this. In
fact, they do it every day. Many students start their programs as baristas, gig
economy workers, or stay-at-home parents. They are regular people who want to
take on a new challenge to change their lives—just like you.

The key here is to figure out how to push through when you come up to those
particularly challenging parts of the program. How do you react when you are
struggling through a concept, or you get a revision request on an assignment
that you spent hours working on, or you don't pass your first capstone review?
Do you take it as a sign that you are a failure, that you weren't meant to do
this, and that you will never be able to do this? Or do you recognize that it
just means that you still have a lot to learn but that learning is possible with
time and effort?

The ability to keep working through problems even when they're really hard, to
get back to work after a setback, [to believe that you have the capacity to
learn new
skills](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve),
and to ask for help when you are struggling—these are the qualities that move
you toward success. [You don't need to be a genius to find
success](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/08/heres-why-your-attitude-is-more-important-than-your-intelligence)
in the program or in your new career. You just need to stay positive and keep
trying as you embrace the mental mindset of problem-solving in each challenge
you encounter.

If you're looking at this list and worrying that you don't check all of these
boxes right now, that's okay! You are not expected to have mastered each of
these skills before you start the program. The important thing is to be aware of
these qualities. Take some time to reflect and identify where you are strong and
where you are going to need more support.
