You can think of this presentation in several different ways. For example, it could be like pitching your product to potential investors. Or it could be like pitching it to a relevant company while interviewing. The key is that this presentation should be engaging, informative, and beautifully put together. It should run approximately 15-30 minutes, and it should be technical but product focused. That means that although you should explain the machine learning that you used, focus more on explaining the product itself, what problem it solves, and why your solution is valuable.

On the day of your presentation, a member of the Thinkful team will introduce you, and then you'll give your presentation. Afterward, they will ask you follow-up questions and will grade your performance on your presentation. Members of the audience will also be encouraged to ask follow-up questions.

Be prepared to talk about the following:

* Your end user and the value that your project provides to them
* Quantifiable results based on the research that you've conducted
* The visuals that you chose and what they represent for your research
* Next steps that you'd take to expand on your work
