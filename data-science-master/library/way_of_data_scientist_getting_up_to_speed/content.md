In this checkpoint, you'll learn about key institutions in data science as you take your first steps into the job search.

Data science is a [digitally native](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/28094/digital-native) profession; accordingly, the data science community is particularly vocal online. Data scientists have also built strong networks on the local and personal levels. A benefit of getting involved with your local network is that your next job is likely to be based locally. So getting to know those already in the industry will go a long way towards being a competitive candidate. In this way, networking bleeds into applying and interviewing for jobs, so you should start to have an idea of the kind of company that you'd like to work for as a data scientist.  

## Grab your seat at the data table

The data science community is a welcoming and often opinionated group. By immersing yourself in popular data science resources, you'll slowly start to speak the language of data science. 

## Social media

One easy way to add some data science to your life is to follow data scientists in your social media feeds. Many of the best and brightest data scientists post regularly on Twitter, using hashtags such as #pydata (for Python), #machinelearning, #datascience, and #dataviz (for data visualization). For suggestions on data scientists to follow, check out [this Twitter list](https://twitter.com/reshamas/lists/notable-data-scientists/members?lang=en). Of particular interest for aspiring data scientists is Renee Teate's account, [@BecomingDataSci](https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci).  

LinkedIn also has a vibrant data science community. Some data science LinkedIn groups, including [Data Science Central](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/35222/) and [Data Mining, Statistics, Big Data, Data Visualization, and Data Science](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/152247/), boast tens of thousands of members. A further list of LinkedIn profiles to follow is available [at KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/09/top-big-data-science-leaders-linkedin.html).

## Websites

Data scientists have their own veritable blogosphere of websites. These sites fall into three broad categories: collaboration, getting help, and sharing knowledge. 

### Collaboration

Perhaps the most indispensable data science website is GitHub. This will be the source of your data science portfolio and the host of code-based projects ranging from open-source software development to Fortune 50 model deployment. GitHub serves as a place for data scientists to showcase their previous projects and collaborate on new ones. 

If GitHub is the platform for collaboration, then [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) is the platform for competition. While Kaggle hosts a vital collection of datasets and an active message board, the site is best known for its data science competitions. In these competitions, teams of data scientists compete for the best model. Many of these competitions are hosted by real corporations, using real data—and with real rewards. 

For example, Netflix offered a million-dollar reward for the algorithm that was best at predicting movie recommendations—not a bad incentive to practice data science! To make things even better, the results of each competition are available after the contest, so data scientists can learn from and compare the results of other contestants. For example, check out [the results of the winning Netflix algorithm](https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data). 


### Getting help

Knowing where to turn when stumped is essential for data scientists. And usually, the place to go is [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com), a question-and-answer board that uses upvoting, reputation scores, and other features to validate the best answer to any question. That said, it's not a good idea to post a question on StackOverflow without doing extensive research and preparing a reproducible example first. (For more guidance on this, see Stack Overflow's [guide to writing a good question](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).) Forum members demand high standards from posters, which can easily blur into haughtiness and plain rudeness. This can be a jarring, unwelcoming experience for new coders, and [StackOverflow itself](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/04/26/stack-overflow-isnt-very-welcoming-its-time-for-that-to-change/) has acknowledged the problem.

Reddit also provides an active platform for getting help with data science, with subreddits like [Data Science](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/), [Learn Machine Learning](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/) and [Learn Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/). 

### Sharing knowledge
Many sites serve both to keep data scientists informed and to provide them with a place to share their knowledge with the community. [KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com) is a leading site for keeping data scientists informed, and [Data Science Central](https://www.datasciencecentral.com) is a rich repository for data scientists to share their knowledge. For a more extensive list of educational resources, check out Thinkful's [Tech Industry Media Resources List](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lfK2M3fCUzgBKpMD9fFIbkecpAPx3sMk-lUTm4xAfaE/edit#).   

Of particular note in the data science blogosphere is the Medium account [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com). This has become a premier source for data scientists to learn and share about their field, almost to the extent of what GitHub has become for collaboration and StackOverflow for getting help.

## Local interest groups

Throughout this program, you'll be geeking out on difficult, technical subjects. It can be a huge relief to find professionals who get paid well to do what you are spending so many painful hours on now. Here are some common ways to meet data scientists in your area: 

- **Meetups:** Check [Meetup's website](https://www.meetup.com) for data-related meetups in your area. These usually take the format of hour-long presentations with Q&As that are sometimes followed by socializing and networking. Some meetups are platform specific; for example, you may find an R or Hadoop users group. Others feature a variety of topics in data science. Meetups give you a glimpse of what professionals in your area are doing with data science, and it strengthens your burgeoning data science network.

- **Kaggle workgroups:** This is a subset of data science meetups that takes a different format from a formal presentation. These workgroups casually meet to discuss and work on a Kaggle problem. This is an opportunity for you to work on data science on a team, in real life. Plus, maybe you'll get a cut of a million-dollar prize! 

- **Hackathons:** These are often weekend-long sprint-like competitions with the goal to build, or *hack*, some digital product. While most hackathons are based around general software development, there is a growing movement of data hackathons, when teams compete to build the best model in a short period of time. Pro tip: While round-the-clock participation at hackathons can be a great experience, it's also okay to just show up at key events, such as the kickoff and final demos, to meet and network with other hackers. 


## Who does the data life best?

When you begin to survey the data science profession's landscape, you'll start to hear some companies—such as Google, Airbnb, and Facebook—mentioned repeatedly. This is the Ivy League of data science teams. And while getting into them may be a dream for some, it's a stretch for most. That's okay; becoming IBM's next AI engineer is not the best choice for everyone.

In fact, starting your data science career at a less-established company may allow more room for ownership and growth. Or perhaps you're more interested in a data science role with high social impact. Start to think about what might be a good fit for you as a data scientist, given your wants, needs, and circumstances. There's no single dream job for a data scientist!
