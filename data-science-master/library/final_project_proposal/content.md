Before you dive into building out your final capstone, craft a proposal for your project. This process will allow you to clarify what you're looking to build. You'll also get feedback on that objective before committing the full time that it would take to build it.

The proposal should be approximately one page long and answer the following questions:

* What is the problem that you are attempting to solve?
* How is your solution valuable?
* What is your data source, and how will you access it?
* What techniques from the program do you anticipate using?
* What is the biggest challenge that you anticipate facing?

When you're answering these questions, form a clear picture of the work that you intend to do, but don't start building out the infrastructure to execute it yet. You may write some code, do some initial scraping, or conduct some initial analysis. But do not actually start building your product until it has been approved.

When you're ready to submit, use the link below. The Thinkful team will get in touch shortly.
