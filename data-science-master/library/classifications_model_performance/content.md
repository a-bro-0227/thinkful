In the previous checkpoint, you used accuracy to test how well your model worked. As it turns out, accuracy may be misleading if it's the only measure of model performance that you're looking at. In this checkpoint, you'll first examine why accuracy alone is not necessarily a good indicator of model performance. Then, you will take a look at some other measures of model performance.

**Note:** In this checkpoint, you'll be using a dataset that is built in to the scikit-learn package. This is a very convenient way for you to experiment with various readily available datasets. To learn more about what datasets are offered and how to access them, consult the [`sklearn.datasets` documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets.html). The code provided in the following Notebook will get you up and going with the *20newsgroups* dataset so that you can follow along.
