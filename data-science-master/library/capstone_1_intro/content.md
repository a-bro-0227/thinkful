In this checkpoint, we are going to go over how to sign up for a GitHub account and how to create a clean and thorough repository (repo) for your projects. Having a hygenic and comprehensive repo is crucial for creating positive first impressions that potential employers and recruiters will have when looking at your projects. 

### Sign up

![](join_github.png)

Sign up for a GitHub account [here](https://github.com/join). You'll need to provide your email address, password, and desired username. Then, submit the form. If the username you want is already taken, GitHub will prompt you to choose a new one.

Next, you'll see a screen where you can select the plan you want. Be sure to pick the default free plan, and leave the "Help me set up an organization next" option unchecked. After that, you'll be prompted to complete a short, optional survey.

Voila! With that, you've created a GitHub account. You'll be taken to a welcome screen where you'll have 2 options: to read the getting started guide or to start a project. If you're interested, feel free to spend a few minutes going through GitHub's guide. Otherwise, click on the "Start a project" button.

At this point, you'll be taken to a screen that tells you to verify your email address. To do this, go to your inbox and find an email from GitHub that asks you to verify your email address. Inside the email, there will be a link you can click on to complete the verification.

Once you've verified your email address, you can go to https://github.com to start a new project. Now, you'll be greeted by the screen you'll see whenever you create a new project on GitHub.


### Create a lovely repo

The first step is creating folders that contain your projects. The titles of the folders should give viewers a good understanding of what they will encounter within the folder.

#### README file

Having a README file is crucial to your project. Your README file will be a markdown file and should be named README.md. The advantage of markdown files are that they are automatically rendered when viewing GitHub in a web browser, therefore will be instantaneously viewable.

Think and approach your README file like you would an abstract for a paper. Make sure to cover the following.

- Goals of the project
- Thought process for the project
- Methods used to create the project
- How to install the project
- How to run the project
- Link to your Jupyter Notebook and explanation

Remember that your README will be the first thing that a potential employer or recruiter look at in your repo. Explain what makes your project so compelling and why you made it. Other possible things to include are as follows.

- Charts
- Diagrams
- Algorithms used, or other model information
- Important points that you discovered during data exploration
- Error rates
- Possibilities for use in the wild


#### Jupyter Notebook

Confirm that your Jupyter Notebook looks good via web browser in GitHub. Your Jupyter Notebook should contain frequent explanations to make clear what you are doing in every step. Employers are looking for data scientists that not only know how to do the analysis but know how to explain it well.

#### Other things

Here are a few other things to include.

- Data sets (csv files, etc.)
- Presentation deck (if there is one)

Lastly, make sure the repo is set to public!

Now that you are armed with this knowledge you will be able to create clean and beautiful repos to share your projects. Your first capstone project will give you the opportunity to execute on this.

The next checkpoint will go into detail about how to create an analytic report and research proposal for your first capstone.
