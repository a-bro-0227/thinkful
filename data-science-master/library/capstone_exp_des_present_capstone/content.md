After your slide deck has been evaluated, you will schedule a live presentation of your research. Your presentation should run about 15-30 minutes and tell a story based on the analysis that you conducted. You should walk your audience through what you researched, what your hypotheses are and how you tested them, and what you found. Make sure to explain why your research is valuable. In this capstone, you will be graded by your peers.

## Preparing for your final presentation

On the day of your presentation, you'll give your presentation to your peers. Members of the audience will participate in asking you questions, and you will ultimately be graded by your peers according to the following rubric.

- **The presenter delivered the material in a clear and structured manner.** The student's presentation had a great structure to deliver the results of the analysis, with all parts aiding in the goals of the presentation. There were no tangents that detracted from the story. The student seemed very prepared and exhibited great presentation skills.
- **The presenter maintained my interest during the entire presentation.**
- **The presenter answered questions effectively.** The presenter was able to provide great answers to all questions. The answers considered the technical level of the audience and had good interpretations.
- **The presenter clearly presented the conclusion and recommendations of the research study.** The student very clearly translated the p-value and interpreted the results in the context of the problem. The student provided or interpreted a confidence interval or some other appropriate measure of the effect size. The student included some clear and logical recommendations or next steps based on the results.
- **The presentation was concise and informative.** The presenter was able to present the challenges, the process, and the conclusions in a brief, logical, and comprehensive manner, enabling the audience to understand the material presented. The presenter provided an accurate and sufficiently complete explanation of key concepts.
- **The presentation provided sufficient details about methods to explain how the study was conducted, but it wasn't too detailed.** The presenter shared which test was being performed, and some reasoning as to why (perhaps not directly mentioning an independent t-test, but mentioned a comparison of means for two independent groups). The presenter shared these details in a very approachable way that a nontechnical audience (or the audience verbally defined by the student) would be easily able to understand.
- **The presentation contained practical examples and useful techniques that applied to current work.** The presenter had an airtight statistical process with all appropriate tests performed.
- **The visual aids were effective.** The presenter was highly effective in using graphics and visual aids that were clean, easy to follow, and told a compelling story without excess text or complex charts.

Remember to focus on desirable presentation skills, such as an appropriate pace, the right depth of coverage for the audience, and effective use of examples and visuals.
Be prepared to talk about the following:

- Your end user and the value that your project provides to them
- Quantifiable results based on the research that you've conducted
- The visuals that you chose and what they represent for your research
- Next steps that you'd take to expand on your work
