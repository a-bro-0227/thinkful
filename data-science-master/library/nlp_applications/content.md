> "A language is not just words. It's a culture, a tradition, a unification of a community, a whole history that creates what a community is. It's all embodied in a language." —Noam Chomsky, [We Still Live Here: Âs Nutayuneân](https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/films/we-still-live-here/)

Welcome to the natural language processing (NLP) module. So far in this program, you learned the fundamentals of data science, including supervised and unsupervised machine-learning techniques. In this module, you'll learn how to work with text data (also called *textual data*) and apply machine-learning algorithms on it.

NLP is a fascinating and rapidly evolving field, and data scientists who are able to work with text data are in high demand in the industry. This high demand can be attributed to the following reasons:

* Text data is very common, and companies want to make use of this type of data. For example, when customers comment on company websites about the products or services that they've purchased, their comments are mostly in the form of free text. From these comments, companies want to gather insights on the quality of their offerings. And based on these insights, they try to improve themselves. Similarly, customer satisfaction is also gauged using these kinds of comments.

* The internet is full of user-generated data, and the majority of this data is in text form. Companies usually scrape the relevant web pages for their businesses and then apply NLP techniques to get useful information. For example, a mobile-phone producer may scrape data from the forums and try to understand how people compare its phones with those of the competitors.

* The majority of the data that is generated within companies is in text form too. For example, think about emails, documents, chat logs, employee reviews, and so on. All of this information is stored as text, and analyzing these could benefit companies in many ways.

The aforementioned points are just a few of a much broader set of reasons; there are many other reasons why NLP is a crucial field in data science. This module is designed to make you familiar with the basics of NLP and give you an understanding of how to work with text data. Upon completing this module, you will be able to work on your own to learn advanced concepts and techniques in NLP.

In this first checkpoint, you'll briefly learn about what natural language processing is. You'll also look at some real-world examples to get a feel for the current state of NLP applications.

## Where to go from here

Now that you've gotten a brief introduction to what NLP is, you're ready for an overview of how you'll proceed in this module. First of all, you should know that NLP is a vast field of data science, and covering all of its important topics is beyond the scope of this module. Rather, you'll focus on getting familiar with the basic tools that are beneficial for working with text data. You'll learn about some of Python's popular NLP libraries, as well as the basic statistical methods and machine-learning techniques.

For this purpose, you'll start by exploring NLP's general concepts and terminology in the next checkpoint. This will help you to understand key language throughout the module. Then, you'll look at data cleaning, focusing on text data, and you'll learn how to build machine-learning models that use text data as inputs. In the process, you'll be introduced to the relevant Python libraries and packages as the need for them arises.

After you complete this module, you'll be prepared to jumpstart your NLP journey by leveraging the popular libraries and methods so that you can enhance your expertise in this field by yourself.

Enjoy!
