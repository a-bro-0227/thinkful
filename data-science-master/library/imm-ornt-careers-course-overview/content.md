## Learning objective

By the end of this checkpoint, you should be able to explain the purpose of the
Careers course.

## Overview

Most Thinkful students want to change careers or level up in their current job.
But changing careers or jobs can be challenging and requires both technical and
nontechnical skills. This Careers course, which is made up of several
career-focused modules, exists to teach you the nontechnical skills that you
need for your job search.

Before you start, check out this overview of the topics that the Careers
course covers:

-   **Networking:** In this module, you'll learn to tell your professional
    story, leverage your current network, and confidently navigate informational
    interviews, meetups, and other industry-specific events.

-   **Personal branding:** In this module, you'll receive guidance and feedback
    as you develop a compelling resume and employer-friendly online profiles.

-   **Job searching:** In this module, you'll learn effective job-search habits,
    how to find and apply to jobs, and how to write stand-out cover letters.

-   **Interviewing:** In this module, you'll receive training and practice for
    each step of the interview processâ€”from phone screen to salary negotiation.

These modules are woven throughout your technical training so that you can apply
them immediately and be ready for your next job by the time that you graduate.

And you're not alone! Both your mentor and the careers team will work with you
to ensure that you're prepared for your job search before you graduate. After
you graduate and complete the mentor-led portion of your program, you will
continue to work with the careers team throughout your job search.

Your job search will require a lot of hard work and will stretch you beyond your
comfort zone. And while the careers team won't place you in a job or conduct
your job search for you, they will provide you with resources, guidance,
feedback, and support, including the following:

-   Checkpoints that show you how to present yourself as a competent and
    desirable candidate

-   Post-graduation access to 1-on-1, individualized career coaching and group
    coaching sessions

-   Technical practice to prepare you for technical evaluations

-   Company referrals to opportunities in the Thinkful network, when applicable
