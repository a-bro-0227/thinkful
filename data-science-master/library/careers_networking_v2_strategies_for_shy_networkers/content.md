## Learning objective

By the end of this checkpoint, you should be able to identify strategies for shy networkers.


## Overview

If you're apprehensive about meeting and connecting with new people, you're not alone. The good news is that there are lots of strategies that you can use to make networking easier—even fun. Here are a few of them. 


## Using the buddy system

Sometimes all you need is a buddy. You can either bring one or become one. 


### Bringing a buddy

If you're shy, invite an outgoing friend to attend events with you. They can start conversations with other attendees, allowing you to jump in when you feel comfortable. However, this is only a good strategy if you _do_ mingle with other attendees. If bringing a friend means that you'll be tempted to talk to only that friend, then it's better to force yourself to attend events alone. 


### Becoming a buddy to solo networkers

Here's an alternative to bringing a friend: When you arrive at an event, scan the room and look for people who are sitting or standing alone. Start conversations with these people; they're probably just as uncomfortable as you are and will be grateful that you made the first move. Plus, because you'll be chatting one on one, you'll have the opportunity to have a deeper conversation than if you tried to jump into an already formed group. 


## Picking the right event for you

Here's some good news: you don't need to enjoy and participate in every style of networking. Just find the styles that you do like—or at least like more than the others—and then do those. 


### Informational interviews

If large groups of people intimidate or overwhelm you, that's okay. Your preferred method of networking might be informational interviews, because they're one on one and are more structured than casual conversations.  


### Task-focused events

Or maybe you're fine with big groups, but you just don't like the forced mingling. In that case, opt for events that are task focused, like hackathons or meetups where you listen to speakers or work on personal projects. That way, you'll still be surrounded by like-minded people, but the conversation will flow naturally while you work on something else.

**Tip:** You can volunteer to help at any event. Just email the organizer ahead of time. This will give you a job to do, which means that no one will expect you to mingle, and it can get you free admission to the event. It will also impress the event's organizers, who are often the best-connected people at the event.


## Trying the notice technique

Sometimes, the hardest part of talking to strangers is knowing how to start the conversation. If that's you, try the *notice technique*. This technique is simple: just notice something about the person you want to talk to or your surroundings, and then comment on it. Here are a few examples:

* Hi, I'm Jamie. How long have you been coming to this event?
* I like your Amazon swag. Do you work there?
* Ooh, the new iPhone! Is the camera really as good as the ads say?
* Have you tried any of these appetizers?
* I love your glasses! Would you mind sharing where you got them?

Generally, it's okay to comment on a person's property, like a backpack. But it's best to avoid commenting on a person's physical features; that can be considered inappropriate or offensive, even if your comment is positive.


## Asking questions

When you're in the middle of a conversation, it's a good strategy to ask (relevant) questions. This takes the spotlight off of you. And it shows that you're curious about the person you're talking to, which is usually appreciated. 


## Networking until it feels natural

Becoming comfortable with networking is a lot like building muscles. Even if you're not great at networking right now, you will get better and more natural at it—and therefore enjoy it more—the more that you do it. You just need to be willing to push through the initial awkwardness.
