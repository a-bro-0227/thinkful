Staying on track in this program requires a lot of discipline and diligence. You'll need to manage your time and goals to make sure that you stay on schedule to complete your program on schedule. All the requirements for completing your program are here on the platform.

In this section, you'll learn about some resources and best practices to help you stay on track. You'll also get familiar with the qualities that are common among successful students. Every student is different, so you'll need to figure out the best strategies for your own needs and situation. The important thing is to have strategies for tackling the work that your program requires.

## Putting in the time and managing it well

It's critical to make time for this program. You'll need to have a system for managing your time and minimizing distractions. Students who are successful in this program are the ones who use a calendar to track their time. They consistently put in at least 20 hours a week (and often more), and they work on their program at least a little bit every day of the week. They have strategies for how they will combat distraction and manage the other demands on their time. They are punctual to all of their mentor sessions and meetings with their academic success managers.

If you know that you struggle to manage your time, you are often late or miss deadlines, or you have a lot of competing demands on your time, then you should be proactive about figuring out strategies that will work for you. The next checkpoint goes over some recommended strategies in more detail.

## Moving yourself forward

Problem-solving is a key skill for succeeding in this program and in the tech industry. Ask any professional data scientist—they will tell you that their job is full of uncertainty and confusion. Rarely do they have a clear step-by-step process of what they are supposed to do or why something isn't working. Much of their day-to-day is figuring things out and feeling (mostly) comfortable with not having things spelled out.

As a student, you'll have a lot of chances to get comfortable with this feeling and build your problem-solving muscles. You should focus on building key traits: following through on things that you start, getting better at finding resources and answers on your own, and figuring out how to approach a problem even when the instructions aren't totally clear.

Thinkful programs are designed to help you build autonomy. The process of becoming an autonomous, problem-solving data scientist is challenging and uncomfortable for most students. When you are just starting out, it's normal to want clear guidance and a lot of hand-holding. This program is designed to support you as you learn, but also to push you to build the skill of finding solutions on your own.

There will be times when you just want your mentor or an expert to tell you the answer—but they aren't going to, and it's going to be frustrating. The moments when you are frustrated are the moments when real learning happens, as long as you can stay motivated and persevere through challenges. When your mentor tells you to google the issue that you are having, they aren't doing it to torture you or because they don't feel like explaining things. They do it because [becoming a Google ninja is an essential skill](https://medium.com/@MouseRat/google-a-developers-best-friend-261d4f02e903) for success as a data scientist, and they want to make sure that you get lots of practice.

One of the most important things that you should remember as you work towards becoming a data scientist is that [confusion is your friend](https://skillcrush.com/blog/confusion-is-your-friend/1347134622000/), not your enemy.

## Interpersonal skills

Sometimes when people imagine a data scientist, they picture someone who sits at a computer all day and never interacts with other people. You might think that interpersonal skills aren't important or necessary for success as a data scientist. However, that's an outdated view of things—if it was ever true to begin with. These days, data scientists work on teams and collaborate every day. They need to be good listeners, be able to clearly explain what they need or what they think should happen, and build a friendly rapport with others.

Technical communication is key to success in this program, on the job search, and in your new career. Technical communication is not just a technical skill—it's also a soft skill that you'll need to practice and improve. If you can't explain your perspective, if you don't listen well, or if you don't care about building relationships with others, then you are going to find your job search very difficult. Make sure to nurture this skill with the same dedication that you put towards mastering technical concepts.

## Grit and resilience

The last piece of the puzzle for finding success in this program, this career, and even in life is resilience.

This program is tough. Learning these skills is tough. If it were easy, everyone would do it. This isn't meant to scare you or make you think that this is an impossible task. It's definitely possible, and regular people can do this. In fact, they do it every day. Many Thinkful graduates start their programs as baristas, gig economy workers, or stay-at-home parents. They are regular people who want to take on a new challenge to change their lives. Just like you.

The key here is to figure out how to push through when you encounter those particularly challenging parts of the program. How do you react when you have a bug that you just can't resolve, or you get a revision request on an assignment that you spent hours working on, or you don't pass your first capstone review? Do you take it as a sign that you are a failure, that you weren't meant to do this, and that you will never be able to do this? Or do you recognize that it just means that you still have a lot to learn, but that learning is possible with time and effort?

The ability to keep working through problems even when they're really hard, to get back to work after a setback, [to believe that you have the capacity to learn new skills](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve), and to ask for help when you are struggling—these are the qualities that move you toward success. [You don't need to be a genius to find success](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/08/heres-why-your-attitude-is-more-important-than-your-intelligence) in the program or as a data scientist. You just need to stay positive and keep trying.

If you're looking at this list and worrying that you don't check all of these boxes right now, that's okay! You aren't expected to have mastered each of these skills before you start the program. The important thing is to be aware of these qualities. Take some time to introspect and identify where you are strong and where you are going to need more support.

## Assignment

Rate yourself on a scale of 1-10 (1 is the lowest, 10 is the highest) for each of these categories and explain your reasoning. For the categories that you are weakest in, describe a few ways that you will commit to improving them.
