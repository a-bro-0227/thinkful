## Learning objective

By the end of this checkpoint, you should understand how to attend events specific to your desired industry.


## Overview

The more people you know, the more people there are to help you with your job search. And different people can provide different types of help, from providing an internal referral, to making an introduction, to sharing industry-specific insights. 

One of the best ways to meet people who are connected to your new industry is by attending local, industry-specific events, like meetups and job fairs. This checkpoint covers what these events are, what to expect, and how to find events in your area.  


## Meetups

*Meetups* are like clubs for people who have a similar interest or demographic, like speaking French, being a woman in tech, or bird-watching. And there are lots of meetups dedicated to a specific profession, including the one that you're studying. Most are free to attend. 

Every meetup is different. Some meetups are focused on talking and socializing; others are centered around an activity, like a speaker or workshop. Some are formal; others are casual. Some have 100+ regular attendees; others have 10. 

In every scenario, meetup attendees are excited about meeting new people and making connections, so you'll be well received. 


### Finding a meetup

To find a meetup in your area, check out these websites:

* [Meetup](http://meetup.com)
* [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/)
* Facebook Groups

On these websites, you can search for meetups in your city. Use keywords like `marketing`, `tech`, or `JavaScript`, and look for study groups, workshops, and presentations. 

You may also see meetups posted in your local Slack community. 

In case Meetup.com is new to you, you can [watch a brief tutorial here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nm_nEvQAGpVy8ruyT4xhambTYOFj_nhx/view?usp=sharing). 


### Best practices for meetups

Like everything else in your job search, it’s important to set some goals for yourself before attending a meetup. Here are some best practices to keep in mind when attending a meetup.

#### Focusing on quality, not quantity

When you attend a meetup, don't feel the need to introduce yourself to absolutely everyone there. On the other hand, don't feel like you should only make connections with employers or people who can immediately advance your career. 

Instead, aim to make between one and three new connections with people you enjoy and would be happy to stay in touch with. 


#### Preparing talking points

It can be helpful to prepare some talking points to use when you meet new people. Although it can be uncomfortable introducing yourself to a stranger, you can easily navigate the ensuing conversation by asking good questions. Here are some good questions to keep in mind: 

* **What do you do?** This question can lead to many others, and it can make it easier to find the person on social media later if you'd like to stay connected. 
* **Have you been in this industry for a while?** This question also sets you up for follow-up questions. For example, you can ask them how they broke into the industry, how they decided what to specialize in, or if they have any tips for someone like you who's getting started in the industry.
* **What do you like to do?** This is a good way to discover other common interests. 
* **Can I find you on LinkedIn?** This question makes more sense after you've been talking for a while, but it's essential if you'd like to follow up in the future. 

Finally, make an effort to be and appear approachable. This can be as simple as smiling and having good posture. 


#### Finding ways to add value

Relationships work best when they're mutually beneficial. 

When you attend a meetup, it's probably because you want to get something, such as connections, information, entertainment, or free food. But it's also important to think about what you can offer the other attendees. Find ways to share _your_ connections, make recommendations, show interest, and show appreciation. 


#### Following up after a meetup

The goal of every meetup is to make new connections. Maintaining those connections requires following up with them after the meetup. Here are a few tips: 

* **Follow up as soon as possible.** This ensures that you'll be remembered. 
* **In your follow-up, remind the person of who you are and how you met.** Help the person you're talking to remember who you are; mention your name and where you met or what you talked about. For example, you could say, "I had a nice time chatting with you about design principles and cats at yesterday's UX meetup." 
* **End your follow-up by requesting another opportunity to connect.** Ask if the person would like to attend another meetup with you, or invite them for a casual coffee or an informational interview (more on those later). 

If the person you're trying to connect with doesn't respond within a week, follow up once more; it's possible that they didn't see your message. 


## Job fairs

Job fairs are events where a large number of companies gather to promote job openings at their company and meet potential candidates. Typically, each company is assigned a booth where they promote their company, and job seekers walk from booth to booth to learn about the various job openings and employers. 

Unlike other events, job fairs are explicitly about hiring—so they're perfect for anyone who's actively looking for a job. Although there isn't a lot of casual peer-to-peer networking, you do have the opportunity to meet and practice pitching yourself to lots of employers in your area, which could lead to an interview or job. 


### Finding a job fair

To find a job fair in your area, check out these websites: 

* [BuiltIn](https://builtin.com/)
* [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/)

Alternatively, Google `job fair` with your industry and location. For example, you could search `job fair tech Seattle` or `job fair marketing New York`.   


### Job fair best practices

As you start finding job fairs that you'd like to attend, here are some best practices to keep in mind. 


#### Researching the job fair

Every job fair is different. To make the best use of your time, try to attend job fairs that are targeted for people in your desired industry. But if there aren't any, that's fine too; general job fairs are also good. 

Additionally, always research the companies that are registered for a job fair. Go online and see what they do and if there are any relevant job listings posted on their website. Then make a list of the companies that you're most interested in talking to. This helps you manage your time when you're at the job fair. 


#### Preparing questions

One of the best ways to make a good impression at a job fair is to come prepared. After you determine which companies you want to talk to, write down a few questions that you can ask the employers of those companies. 

A good rule is to prepare a mix of questions that show that you've done your research. You can ask about a specific role that you saw posted on their website, a recent product or blog post that they released, or something related to one of their company values, like their volunteer program. 


#### Practice your pitch

When you're at a job fair, you're probably going to be making a lot of introductions and having a lot of short conversations. Recruiters and employers may ask you to tell them about yourself. To make a good impression, practice your pitch before every job fair. 

Use the techniques that you learned in the _Telling Your Story_ checkpoint; the key is to be confident and friendly, identify your relevant and transferable strengths, and show how those strengths can benefit the company of the employer who you're talking to. 


#### Dressing for success

Job fairs might not be formal interviews, but you're still being evaluated. This means that you should dress as if you were going to an interview. This shows employers that you're a professional and you are taking the event and their time seriously.


#### Trading contact information

While it's recommended to have copies of your resume or business cards to give to employers at job fairs, it's also your job to follow up.

If you're interested in a company, be sure to get the contact information of the employer who you're talking to. If an employer offers you a general business card for the company, politely ask them if they're willing to provide you with _their_ name and email address. This allows you to follow up with an actual human instead of the company's general inbox—which may or may not be forwarded to the right person. 


#### Following up after a job fair

Within 24 hours of attending a job fair, send follow-up emails to everyone who you connected with. Be sure to mention the name of the event, attach your resume (if it's updated), and mention something specific about your conversation to help them remember who you were. Here's an example of a strong follow-up: 


>Hello, John!
>
>Thank you again for taking the time to chat with me about Google at the Mountain View Job Fair earlier today. It was really great to learn more about the work that you're doing and to hear that you place such an emphasis on collaboration—something that's important to me too.
>
>I gave you a copy of my resume at the event, but, in case it's helpful, attached is a digital version as well. While I have your attention, I thought I'd also mention that I applied for the Data Scientist II role that we talked about. It looks like a great fit for me, and I look forward to the opportunity to cross paths again in the near future.
>
>Regards, 
>
>Lucy


## Picking the right events

Because your time is limited, it's important to pick the networking events that are most likely to further your goals. To help you pick the right events, here are a few details to pay attention to:

* **Number of attendees:** Based on the registration list, are there enough people registered for the event to make it worth your time?
* **Types of attendees:** Based on the registration list, are there people who can help you move closer to a potential employer? Are there people who would be valuable to connect with?
* **Topic:** Is the event topic interesting to you? Could you see yourself going to this event regularly?
* **Cost:** If the event requires money, is it worth the investment?
* **Reviews:** Do you know anyone who has attended this event in the past? Are there reviews online?


Ultimately, all networking is good networking. You either make new connections who can help you move closer to your career goals, or you learn from what went poorly so that you can have a better experience at the next event.
