In this module, you learned the basics of deep learning and the fundamental architecture of artificial neural networks. During the examples in the checkpoints, you used a *MNIST* dataset. In this challenge, you'll work with another dataset: [fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist). Using this dataset, do the following:

1. Preprocess your data so that you can feed it into ANN models.
2. Split your data into training and test sets.
3. Try different ANN models and train them on your training set. You can play with the following:  

    1. Number of layers  
    2. Activation functions of the layers  
    3. Number of neurons in the layers  
    4. Different batch sizes during training  
    
4. Compare your models' training scores and interpret your results.
5. Evaluate how your models perform on your test set. Compare the results of your models.

This challenge will *not* be graded, but you may wish to keep a copy of your Notebook available for future reference and review. Good luck!
