One of the best things about being part of the Thinkful community is that you never have to learn alone.  Thinkful provides a strong support team to help you achieve your learning goals. 

In this checkpoint, you'll learn about various aspects of the Thinkful data science community. 

Specifically, you're going to learn about the following features:

- Your academic success team
- Your mentor
- Technical coaches

By the end of this checkpoint, you will be able to navigate your dashboard to find and sign up for support resources and be able to distinguish the type of support you should use for any challenge you encounter. 


## Your academic success team

Your academic success team helps you navigate the journey to becoming a data scientist and holds you accountable for putting in the work necessary to succeed. Whether you have questions about your enrollment, time management, or general Thinkful policies, support is available when you need it. To reach out, simply email your question to prep@thinkful.com. Additionally, you can find the same information at the top of your Overview dashboard.


## Your mentor

Your mentor is there to give you data science-specific guidance through your program. You will meet with them every week through video sessions at a designated URL. 

Your mentor is an experienced data scientist who can provide you with advice about what it's like to be a professional data scientist. They help to unravel tricky concepts, hold you accountable to your goals, and talk you through imposter syndrome. You can find your mentor's information at the top of your Overview dashboard.

#### Availability

One of the first things that you did when you enrolled was set your availability for mentor sessions. This allows available mentors to be matched with you. You can update your availability at any time in the **Settings** menu in your account.


### What are good things to talk about in my mentor sessions?

In your first session with a new mentor, you should discuss your goals and learning strategies. How would you like your session to flow? Do you want your mentor to push you hard or to be your cheerleader? 

Thinkful encourages students to use time with their mentor to ask questions about the curriculum or class and discuss any problems that came up when working on your assignments or projects. Sessions might also include a review of your work. Be sure to come to your session prepared to talk about what you've been working on and what you'd like to accomplish. You and your mentor might pair up on your current project, or your mentor might walk you through some relevant examples. 

Mentors love feedback. If there's something your mentor does that is particularly useful, let them know. If there's something that feels less productive, tell them that as well. Each student wants something slightly different from their mentor. By being communicative, you can continually shape your time together so that it's most productive for you. 


### What if I have to miss a session?

If something comes up, notify your mentor in advance, ideally at least 24 hours beforehand. If you don't inform your mentor 24 hours in advance, your session will be forfeited. If you do give advance notice, your mentor might be able to reschedule your session for a time that works for both of you.

### What if my mentor and I aren't the right fit (for any reason)?

If things aren't working out, send an email to prep@thinkful.com! It is important for the Thinkful team to make sure that you are comfortable and that you feel you are accomplishing the goals you set for yourself during sessions with your mentor.

## Technical coaches

As you work through your data science prep curriculum, you will inevitably have moments where you are stuck and don't know what to do next. Don't panic! Getting stuck is a very important part of the learning process. 

Once you've spent 30 minutes trying to solve your issue, if you still find that you are stuck, Thinkful has a team of experienced technical data science coaches to answer your questions and point you in the right direction. (You can start talking with a technical coach by opening the chat in the lower-right corner of the screen when you're viewing the curriculum.) Please note that technical coaches won't do your work for you and usually won't give you a direct answer to your question. Instead, coaches will help guide you in figuring out the answer on your own. It's important that you build your skills related to troubleshooting, debugging, understanding errors, and researching solutions. 

The technical coaching team aims to respond within 10 minutes to any questions that are posted in the chat during regularly scheduled support hours. If you post a question during regularly scheduled support hours, please stick around to monitor the chat and work with a coach. If you post a question during off-hours, check back during the next staffed hour that works for you. If you don't respond to a post within 4 hours, it will be automatically closed. So make sure you keep an eye on the chat!

You can get help from a technical coach by opening the chat in the lower-right corner of the screen when you're viewing the curriculum. Technical coaches will know which checkpoint you opened the chat on, so be sure to always begin your chat from the checkpoint that you need help with.

Here are some tips to help you receive a useful answer from a technical coach:

- Phrase your question in a way that is easy to understand to make it easy for someone to provide you with the help you need. Get help faster and reduce the need for follow up questions by including the following elements in your answer:

1. What you've already tried
2. The error message you are getting, 
3. The specific thing that's giving you trouble. 
4. Avoid posting "I have a question." 

- Formatting makes things easier for everyone. Make sure to format the code you're referencing in a snippet.
- Keep all questions about one topic in the same *chat*.
- **Start your chat on the page of the curriculum that you need help with.** Coaches will know which page of the curriculum you're on when you open the chat. Opening the chat in the curriculum page where you're having a problem will allow coaches to help you more effectively and efficiently.
