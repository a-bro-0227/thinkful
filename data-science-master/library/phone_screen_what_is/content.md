Data scientists use established frameworks or [mental models](http://mentalmodels.princeton.edu/about/what-are-mental-models/) to analyze problems. Many of these, like the [five why's](https://open.buffer.com/5-whys-process/) (also known as the 5 W's) of root cause analysis, are exceptionally simple. 

The [5 W's](https://its.unl.edu/bestpractices/remember-5-ws) of requirements gathering is often introduced in grade school, but professionals (such as data scientists) use the process frequently to establish basic facts about a phenomenon. Generally, the 5 W's are answered in the order of "who, what, when, where, why," but to add clarity, their order will be shifted in the content below. After all, as the saying goes: "Know the rules well, so you can break them effectively." 

## What is a phone screen? 

A phone screen is a short interview conducted to determine whether an applicant meets the required qualifications needed for a job. Phone screens are quick, to-the-point discussions usually lasting no more than 30 minutes.  

Questions for a phone screen generally relate to a candidate's background, work history, and interest in a particular job, company, and industry. It is less common to include in-depth behavioral or technical questions, but some interview processes follow a different pattern. 

## When are phone screens in the interview process? 

The phone screen will be your first interview after you apply. This will be the initial time that you will formally speak with someone in the organization as part of the interview process. 

## Who conducts a phone screen? 

As an early-stage interview, phone screens are likely to be conducted by recruiters and used to decide which candidates to present to the hiring manager. 

## Where do phone screens occur?  

Phone screens are normally held over the phone. It is less common for them to be held over videoconferencing systems like Skype or Zoom and exceedingly rare for them to be held in person. For reasons further explained in the next "W" below, the phone is the ideal medium at this point because it's the least expensive way to screen candidates.

## Why do phone screens occur? 

According to [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/50-hr-recruiting-stats-make-think/), 250 candidates apply to the average corporate job opening. Of these candidates, four to six will be called for an interview, and only one will be offered a job.

With this volume of applications, recruiters must "screen" candidates, typically over the phone, so that they are only left with those who satisfactorily meet the job requirements. Videoconferencing is more involved and is likelier to have technical issues. In-person interviewing takes even more resources and effort. The phone is the quickest way to move forward with or cut candidates in an interview format.  

A phone screen is not about getting to know you as a candidate personally and determining whether you'd be a good fit culturally with the company. It's more of a "three strikes and you're out" type of environment where enough missteps from you as the candidate will disqualify you from moving on in the interview process.

In the next checkpoint, you will learn practical steps for how to prepare for a phone screen so that you can make it through to a formal interview.
