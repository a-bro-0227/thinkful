Most students join this program to switch to a new field. Switching careers is challenging, and there's more to it than just having strong technical skills! Throughout the Data Science program, you'll start to prepare for your job search by getting to know your local job market and creating a compelling online professional persona. This checkpoint will give you an overview of how you'll collaborate with the careers team to land your dream job.

## Your new career

Congratulations! You are well on your way to your new career. That's a huge step, and your continued determination and hard work will be essential to reaching your goal.

A successful job search, especially one in a new field, takes a lot of planning and preparation. It's not something that you can put off until the end of your program and still expect to be successful. That's why there are career preparation checkpoints embedded throughout your program. Step by step, you will learn and practice everything that goes into a successful job search.

On your end, you'll be expected to go through the career-specific content and complete all of the career checkpoints. The assignments in these checkpoints will ensure that you're equipped with the necessary job market skills and that you're on track for graduation (and for your tuition guarantee, if applicable).

Here's what to expect to learn from the careers curriculum:

- **Brand yourself as a data scientist.** You will learn to act like and think about yourself as a data scientistâ€”not as someone who dreams of being one or identifies as an aspiring data scientist.
- **Learn how to network like a pro.** You will master the art of networking in all its forms (even if you're an introvert!). You will learn how to present yourself, talk about your experience, and leverage your connections.
- **Make your materials job-search ready.** You will receive guidance and feedback in creating the most effective job search materials, including resumes, cover letters, LinkedIn profiles, and more.
- **Practice technical and nontechnical interviews.** You will receive training in the latest technical interview techniques and have chances to practice both technical and behavioral interviews with experienced hiring managers.
- **Navigate a job offer.** You will receive coaching in how to evaluate and negotiate job offers.

Much of this training will occur while you are still in your program. You will work with both your mentor and the careers team to make sure that you are on track to successfully land a role once you are ready.

## What will the careers team help me with once I've graduated?

After you've completed the mentor-led section of the program, you will continue to work with the careers team; they will help you execute a successful job search. Remember that the careers team won't place you in a job or conduct your job search for you. Their job is to help get you ready for a successful search by providing you with resources, guidance, and feedback. You should still expect that your job search will involve a lot of hard work. You will probably need to stretch yourself to go beyond your comfort zone.

The careers team will help you develop your materials, hone a practical approach to your search, strategize salary negotiation, and more. Once you complete your program, you'll work with your career coach to guide you through the ins and outs of a successful job search and hold you accountable for the necessary steps to launching your career as a data scientist.

As you prepare for your job search, here's what you can expect from Thinkful:

- **Lessons** that take a cumulative approach to building your profile as a technical candidate
- **Workshops** that are designed to set you up for success as you approach your job search
- **Weekly career office hours** where you can ask dedicated career coaches those burning questions
- **One-on-one individualized career coaching** as well as **group coaching sessions** that you can access after graduation
- **Technical practice** to ensure that you're ready for any and all technical evaluations
- **Company referrals** to opportunities in the Thinkful network, when applicable
