Throughout your program, Slack will be a critical resource for you to get support and connect with others in the Thinkful community. Knowing how to use Slack effectively can make a big difference in your experience, so it's important that you know the best practices for using Slack and for getting the help that you need.

Learning to be a savvy Slack user is also a smart move for your future career. Currently, more than [85,000 companies use Slack](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/slack-now-has-more-than-10-million-daily-active-users/), and the majority of those are tech companies. Once you are working as a data scientist, the chances are high that you'll find yourself using Slack daily to do your job.

## Slack features and productivity tips

Slack has a ton of ways to help you use it more effectively and increase your productivity. Here are a few key tips:
- **Master notifications.** If you aren't careful, Slack notifications can take over your life; this means that you can easily get overwhelmed or miss the information that you are really interested in. Slack gives you a lot of power to adjust what you get notifications for and how those notifications look. Go to **Preferences** to set your notifications by channel or to add keywords that you want to be alerted to. You can also change what you are notified about in the app, on your phone, and by email. Play around and see what works for you. In the middle of something important? You can also mute your notifications by clicking the **Notifications** ðŸ”” icon in your sidebar.

- **Threads keep it clean.** Many of Thinkful's Slack channels are busy and noisy. It's easy to get lost when people are responding to each other about different topics. To keep things clean and easy to read, use threads. If you see a post that you'd like to respond to, or if you want to add something to your own post, hold the pointer over the post and click the **Start a thread** ðŸ’¬ icon. This will take you to a thread in your sidebar. Now, all the posts for this conversation will be in one easy-to-find place.

 - **Adjust your notification preferences.** You can set your notification preferences to alert you when someone responds to a thread that you started or responded to. If there's too much noise, you can stop getting notifications for responses to a thread by holding your pointer over the post, clicking the **More actions â‹®** icon, and then clicking **Unfollow thread**.

- **Shortcuts FTW!** Rather than scrolling all over to find what you need, use Slack shortcuts to help you work faster. To see a list of shortcuts, press `Control+/` (`Command+/` on a Mac) when you have the Slack app open.
- **Remind me.** Just saw an interesting message but don't have time to respond immediately? Hold the pointer over the message and click the **More actions** icon. Then click **Remind me about this** and set a time when you want Slack to send you a reminder. You can also type `/remind` and tell Slackbot to remind you about anything you like.

- **Tag responsibly.** If you have a message that you want a person or a small group of people to notice right away, you can send them a notification by sending them a direct message (located under the **Channels** section in the sidebar) or by tagging them using the `@` function. However, avoid using `@here` or `@channel`, because these tags will send notifications to all of the members in that groupâ€”which could include thousands of people!

## Contributing to the conversation

Our Slack community is awesomeâ€”and that's because everyone there contributes to a vibrant community where people support and respect each other. These are the guidelines that we expect everyone in Thinkful's Slack community to follow:
- Be helpful, not hurtful. No harassment of any kind will be tolerated. Make sure that what you are adding is respectful before you post or send messages.
- Do not question or challenge the way someone self-identifies or self-expresses.
- Do not make general statements or public assumptions about groups that you do not belong to or do not know much about.
- Public advocacy for participants to be banned is not acceptable. To address any specific concerns, email an academic success manager.
- Do not make unwelcome or uninvited comments regarding a person's choices and lifestyle practices.
- Do not make offensive or derogatory comments related to physical appearance, body size, age, race, language, national origin, ethnic origin, nationality, immigration status, religion or lack thereof, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, (dis)ability, mental health, or similar identifying traits.
- This is a channel for dialogue and conversation, so avoid sales pitches of any kind. If you would like to sell something, speak with an administrator before you offer services. All job offers or job listings may be posted to the #job_opportunities channel.
- Be mindful of the many voices in the community. Ensure that there is room for any group members who may want to join the conversation.
- If you read something that offends you, explain why and move on. If you feel that something is hurtful or violates the group guidelines, email the group administrator.
- Do not send excessive direct messages (DMs) to anyone in the community. Do not harass people who don't respond to messages.
- Remember, you're on the internet. Any information that you don't want to spread outside this group should not be posted to the group.

That's it! You are now ready to be a Slack master. Time to get in there and make some new friends!
