Take the well-known [20 newsgroups](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/) dataset and use each of the methods on it.  Your goal is to determine which method, if any, best reproduces the topics represented by the newsgroups.  Write up a report where you evaluate each method in light of the 'ground truth'- the known source of each newsgroup post.  Which works best, and why do you think this is the case?
