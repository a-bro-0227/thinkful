In this checkpoint we will go through how to prepare for the mock interview and presentation you will be giving as a part of this first capstone. At the end of this checkpoint, we'll ask you to submit your final materials for your capstone project to be reviewed by our grading team.


## Presenting your first capstone and evaluation

Once you've completed your capstone materials, you'll need to schedule a time to present it to a Thinkful educator. This will be a one-on-one presentation with an educator who will listen to your presentation and then ask follow up questions. Ultimately, they'll provide you with written feedback on your capstone.

Once you've completed this module, the following goal in your dashboard will prompt you to [schedule a time to meet with someone](https://overview.thinkful.com) for this presentation.


To help you prepare for your capstone review, here are a few examples of the types of questions you'll be asked:

* Did you have any challenges with this data?
* Why did you choose this dataset?
* How did your dataset inform the questions you chose to explore?
* What issues did you run into while analyzing your data?
* Imagine someone sees this visualization out in the wild, separated from your report. What conclusions would you expect them to draw? Is that the conclusion that you *want* them to draw?
* How could you make your conclusions more rigorous?

You should also take some time to review [the rubric that you'll be scored on](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18Z0aaE6mWIhUomdzfVZqYeAzw51-iEz_lGHIPwM-3ls/edit#gid=0).

Here's a few last pieces of advice:

* Grammar matters. A lot. This should be a professional and easy to read document.
* State the questions you aim to answer clearly and answer them specifically.  Make sure to use markdown to properly format your questions.
**Including your code is required** but we should also be able to read your report and understand your visualizations without having to look at that code. Whether you include your code in the report with an iPython notebook or in a separate file is up to you.
* Your goal should be to give us an understanding of your dataset and the behaviors present in it. As such use analytics and statistics to tell a story about the data, don't just give us statistics without context.
* Try to translate real questions into statistical questions rather than simply ask statistical questions.
* Use at least 2-3 different types of charts to display the data.
* Be clear about any assumptions you make about the data and validate those assumptions if possible.
* Ensure that your dataset actually has the information to answer the questions you're asking. Does the dataset have a bias? Is it incomplete? Problems with your dataset can easily lead to problems in your analysis if you don't address them.
