Before digging into the nuts and bolts of working with text data, you need to get familiar with the basic terminology used in natural language processing. In this checkpoint, you'll be introduced to some basic concepts and terms that are widely used in NLP. In the rest of the module, these terms will be used heavily, so you'll need to learn them before continuing any further. 

You'll also get a brief overview of the main NLP packages in the Python ecosystem that you'll be using throughout the module. Specifically, you'll look at the NLTK, spaCy, and Gensim packages. You'll also use additional packages in the following checkpointsâ€”but because they're auxiliary libraries, you'll be introduced to them just before you start to use them.
