Below is a series of data science technical interview questions arranged by subject. As mentioned previously, you should assume that your actual technical interview will be conducted in person, over a whiteboard. While Python is required for only some of these technical questions, feel free to jot your thoughts and illustrations on a whiteboard for more general questions as well. 

Your mock interview will be conducted remotely, so for this assignment, you will use [A Web Whiteboard](https://awwapp.com) as a digital whiteboard substitute. The basic level is free and requires no login. Share your screen using this page during your interview. 

<!-- What do you think of doing something like making a Jupyter Notebook here? --> 

1. How do you convert a string to a float and vice versa in Python?
2. What is backpropagation?
3. How to combine two one-dimensional lists into one one-dimensional list?
4. What does the `HAVING` clause do in SQL?
5. What is the difference between an `INNER JOIN` and a `LEFT OUTER JOIN`?
6. What is a Python module?
7. What is PEP-8?
8. What are some different ways to treat missing values?
9. What is the difference between artificial intelligence and machine learning?
10. What are some metrics for evaluating the performance of linear regression?
11. Write a function that asks the user for a string, then print whether the string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.
12. What does the `LIMIT` clause do in SQL?
13. What is underfitting and how do you prevent it?
14. What is a nonparametric model? What are its advantages and disadvantages?
15. What is the difference between a `for` loop and a `while` loop?
16. What is the difference between statistics and machine learning?
17. What is the output of `-12 // 10`?
18. Write a function that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.
19. When might you use a random forest versus a support vector machine, and why?
20. The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: `1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦`. Write a function that asks the user how many Fibonacci numbers to generate and then generates them.
21. What is an autoencoder?
22. What is bagging and boosting in an ensemble model?
23. What is a loss function in a neural network?
24. What is an RDBMS?
25. What is regularization, and why is it useful?
26. Explain what false positives and false negatives are. When might one be more important than another?
27. What is the binomial distribution? What are some examples of phenomena that follow a binomial distribution?
28. Write a function that takes a list and returns a new list containing all unique elements of the first list (without any duplicates).
29. Why is the area under the curve a better evaluation metric than raw accuracy?
30. What is the bias-variance tradeoff?
31. Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Ask the players to input plays. Compare them, then print a message of congratulations to the winner and ask if the players want to play again.
32. What is selection bias?
33. Explain precision and recall. How do they relate to the ROC curve?
34. What is a perceptron in machine learning?
35. Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a list of only the first and last elements of that list.
