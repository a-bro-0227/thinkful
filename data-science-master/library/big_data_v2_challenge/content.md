In this challenge, you'll replicate one of the supervised learning projects that you did before in the program. This time, you'll use Dask instead of pandas and NumPy. Follow the instructions below:

* The aim of this challenge is to get your hands dirty on writing code using Dask. This is why there is no minimum or maximum limit on the size of the dataset that you can use.
* Use Dask counterparts to replicate all the data-cleaning and machine-learning parts of your supervised learning project. In other words, do the following:

    * Instead of pandas DataFrames, use Dask DataFrames whenever possible.
    * Instead of NumPy arrays, use Dask arrays whenever possible.
    * Use Dask to parallelize your model trainings.
    
Then, submit your work on Github and share the link below. Good luck!
