In this module, you'll learn about a new class of models: similarity models. These are exactly what they sound like: learning through similarity. You'll explore similarity models as an overarching concept as well as their classic example: k-nearest neighbors.

Specifically, you'll learn about the following:

* Nearest neighbors modeling
* Choosing *k*
* K-nearest neighbors for regression and classification

When you're ready to get started, continue on.
