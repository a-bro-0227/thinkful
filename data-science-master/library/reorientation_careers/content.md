Throughout the curriculum, you’ll be indirectly working with the careers team in checkpoints such as *Professional branding* and *Build your professional network* to ensure that you’ll be prepared for your job search. Once you graduate from data science immersive, the careers team will support you as you embark on your job search with an assigned career coach. 


## What are some of the things that will be covered in the careers curriculum?

Step-by-step, you will learn and practice everything that goes into a successful job search.

Here’s what to expect to learn from our career prep:

- **Brand Yourself as a data scientist**: You will learn to act like and think about yourself as a **data scientist** - not as someone who dreams of being one or is an “aspiring data scientist.”
- **Learn How to Network Like a Pro:** You will master the art of networking in all its forms (even if you are an introvert!). You will learn how to present yourself, talk about your experience, and leverage your connections.
- **Make Your Materials Job Search Ready:** You will receive guidance and feedback in creating the most effective job search materials including resumes, cover letters, LinkedIn profiles, and more.
- **Practice Technical and Non-Technical Interviews:** You will receive training in the latest technical interview techniques and have chances to practice both technical and behavioral interviews with experienced hiring managers.
- **Navigate a Job Offer:** You will receive coaching in how to evaluate and negotiate job offers.


## What will the Careers team help me with?

The careers team will help you develop your materials, hone a practical approach to your search, strategize salary negotiation, and more. Once you complete your program, you’ll work with your career coach to guide you through the ins and outs of a successful job search and hold you accountable to the necessary steps to launching your career as a data scientist. 

The job search will involve a lot of hard work and stretching yourself to go beyond your comfort zone. Some of the resources we offer are below.


- **Lessons** that take a cumulative approach to build your profile as a technical candidate.
- **Workshops** that are designed to set you up for success as you approach your job search.
- **Weekly career office hours** where you can ask our dedicated career coaches those burning questions.
- Post-graduation access to **1-1 individualized career coaching** and **group coaching sessions.**
- **Technical practice** to ensure that you’re ready for any - and all - technical evaluations.
- **Company referrals** to opportunities in our network, when applicable.

We expect you to go through all careers content and complete all of our career checkpoints. These checkpoints are assignments that are needed to ensure that you’re equipped with the necessary job market skills as well as on track for graduation and your tuition guarantee, if applicable.
