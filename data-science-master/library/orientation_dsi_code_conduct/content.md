By the end of this checkpoint, you will have read the Code of Conduct and be able to describe its importance in the context of your success in the prep program.

### What we expect and what you can expect

Being a part of the Thinkful community is a relationship based on mutual accountability. You can hold us accountable for providing you with an effective curriculum, a skilled team of educators, and a support networkâ€”all with the aim of helping you to be ready to get hired as a data scientist. Conversely, we will also hold you accountable for your commitment and behavior in this prep program. 

## Attendance

Your program is a significant time commitment, and students are expected to do everything possible to be in the sessions. But Thinkful does understand that life happens! If you need to miss time away from the course for any reason, please submit an [absence request form](https://thinkful.typeform.com/to/CmatYh) and notify your instructor as soon as possible. You should also be prepared to send a quick catch up plan to your Academic Success Manager by the following day. 

Students are permitted to miss no more than three days cumulative, or be more than 10 minutes late to 5 workshops. Not responding to staff via Slack or email within one hour during set class hours is considered an absence. Students who miss more than three days will not remain eligible for graduation or their tuition guarantee. However, you should always check out the [Course Catalog](https://getstarted.thinkful.com/regulatory-information) or reach out to your academic success manager for more details.


## Our Code of Conduct

Thinkful is a community and can only thrive if every member of it contributes and acts with respect and collegiality. That's why we take our Code of Conduct so seriously and expect everyone in our community (students, educators, academic success managers, etc.) to abide by it. 

*We expect you to adhere to the following policies:*
- Actively and wholeheartedly participate in all workshops, assignments, activities, and assessments that are part of the Thinkful experience. This also includes being receptive to feedback and criticism.
- Make learning your top priority throughout the Thinkful program.
- Acknowledge that all Thinkful educational materials provided, physically or electronically, are for your own personal use only. Do not reproduce, save, or copy any educational materials provided for any use other than your own personal study. Do not make public (such as by posting online) any such study workshops, materials, or code provided by Thinkful.
- Be respectful and conduct yourself professionally while at Thinkful or in the community (at meetups, hackathons, and other schools or with employers, recruiters, etc.). 
- Show consideration for your fellow classmates, Thinkful staff, and mentors by respecting everyone's backgrounds and not expressing sexism, racism, homophobia, ageism, ableism, or any other behavior deemed inappropriate for a healthy learning environment.
- Ask for help when you need it, whether it is technical or personal. Prioritize your physical and mental well-being.
- Complete all the coursework yourself. Do not allow outside parties to use your student dashboard or submit work on your behalf.

In addition, the following are *not* permitted and will result in disciplinary action including loss of the [Tuition Refund Guarantee](https://tf-assets-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/shoebill/PDFs/thinkful-job-guarantee.pdf), repetition of work, or dismissal from your program:

- Uncooperative or disrespectful behavior to your fellow classmates, colleagues, instructors, community members, and staff.
- Disruptive activity that causes the obstruction of teaching, learning, or the administration of Thinkful programs.
- Acts of falsity, including, but not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, forgery, submitting work that is not your own, or other acts of academic dishonesty.
