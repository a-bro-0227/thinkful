Being a part of the Thinkful community is a relationship based on mutual accountability. You can hold us accountable for providing you with an effective curriculum, a skilled team of mentors and educators, and a support network—all with the aim of helping you to be ready to get hired as a data scientist.

Conversely, we also will hold you accountable for your commitment and behavior in this program. We aren't interested in policing our students or making people jump through hoops for our own amusement. We hold you to these expectations because we know that you won't be successful at Thinkful or in your future career if you can't meet them.

Thinkful isn't just a place to learn technical skills; it's also a place to hone your professional and soft skills. This is what will set you apart from the crowd of candidates when you are in your job search and will help you maximize your growth potential in your new career.

## Your responsibilities as a Thinkful student

The first thing to know about this program is that it's going to take time. You have to work hard and put in the hours if you want to succeed. The Thinkful curriculum is not something that you can master by putting in a few hours on the weekend. This program is something that takes consistent, dedicated time and effort. In our experience, people who are able to work on their program every day have the best results.

If you want specifics, we crunched the data; based on past student experiences, being successful in this program requires at least 20-25 hours per week or 2-3 hours per day. Think about your schedule. Where are you going to make time for your coursework? What will you be giving up to make room? How will you hold yourself accountable and stay on track? What tools or strategies will help?

Many people choose Thinkful because we offer a flexible online learning program that allows you to build new skills without having to put the rest of your life on hold. You can schedule mentor sessions and study at the times that work for you. However, the only nonnegotiable in this arrangement is this minimum time commitment to the program.

We expect you to treat this program like it's your job. That means acting professionally, taking your assignments seriously, communicating with us promptly, and showing up. Treat every mentor session like a meeting with your supervisor at work. Be on time, let your mentor know beforehand if you will not be able to make it to a session, dress appropriately, and come prepared.

One of the best parts about Thinkful is our awesome community of hard-working, supportive, and committed students and alumni. We've worked hard to build this community, and we expect all Thinkful students to contribute to it and to keep it awesome. All of our policies on what you are responsible for and what you can expect as a Thinkful student are described in our [Course Catalog](https://www.thinkful.com/course-catalog/). We expect you to review this catalog and abide by everything listed there.

Below are a few of the most important points from the catalog. We want to make sure to cover these points, but we still expect you to read through the entire catalog. Know that you'll be held accountable to all of the rules and policies listed there.

## Attendance

Thinkful knows that sometimes life happens—severe illness or an unexpected life change may mean that a student needs to stop their coursework. In the Data Science Flex program, you have the option to pause your program. If you need to take a more extended break from the program, you can withdraw temporarily. Thinkful will save your progress, and you can pick up where you left off once you return. If you decide not to resume your program, or if you don't complete the required academic work after your pause ends, then you will be withdrawn from the program and issued a refund calculated based on Thinkful's Refund Policy. If you need to take a longer pause or withdraw temporarily, we can't guarantee that you will be able to continue working with the same mentor. For many more specifics and details on your withdrawal options and pausing timeframes, refer to the [Course Catalog](https://getstarted.thinkful.com/regulatory-information).

The most important thing to remember here is to communicate with us. If you disappear, become uncommunicative, or don't respond to our messages, then we are going to assume that you aren't continuing with your program, and we will remove you. If you don't want that to happen, make sure to be proactive about letting us know what's going on.

## Our Code of Conduct

Thinkful is a community and can only thrive if every member contributes and acts with respect and collegiality. That's why we take our Code of Conduct so seriously and expect everyone in our community—from students to mentors to academic success managers—to abide by it. Make sure that you understand the guidelines, because we will be holding you to them.

We expect you to do the following:
- Arrive to your mentor sessions on time. Be prepared with questions or topics to discuss, and stay until the end.
- If you're late, need to leave early, or have any unplanned absences, provide a timely explanation and make up any missed work. If you need to be absent, give at least 24 hours' notice for any absences, barring unexpected illness or emergency.
- Actively and wholeheartedly participate in all workshops, assignments, activities, and assessments that are part of the Thinkful experience. This also includes being receptive to feedback and criticism.
- Make learning and participation in mentor sessions your top priorities throughout the Thinkful program.
- Acknowledge that all Thinkful educational materials provided, physically or electronically, are for your own personal use only. Do not reproduce, save, or copy any of the provided educational materials for any use other than your own personal study. Do not make public (for example, by posting online) any study workshops, materials, or code provided by Thinkful.
- Be respectful and conduct yourself professionally while at Thinkful and in the community (for example, at meetups, hackathons, at other schools, with employers, and with recruiters).
- Show consideration for your fellow classmates, Thinkful staff, and mentors by respecting everyone's backgrounds. Do not express sexism, racism, homophobia, ageism, or ableism. Avoid any behaviors deemed inappropriate for a healthy learning environment. And remember the golden rule: treat others the way you would like to be treated.
- Ask for help when you need it, whether it is technical or personal. Prioritize your physical and mental well-being.
- Complete all the coursework yourself. Do not allow outside parties to use your student dashboard or submit work on your behalf.

In addition, the following are not permitted and will result in disciplinary action, including loss of the Tuition Refund Guarantee, repetition of work, or dismissal from your program:
- Uncooperative or disrespectful behavior to your fellow classmates, colleagues, instructors, community members, and staff
- Disruptive activity that causes the obstruction of teaching, learning, or administration of Thinkful programs
- Acts of falsity, including, but not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, forgery, submitting work that is not your own, or other acts of academic dishonesty
