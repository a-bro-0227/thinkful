Now you're going to spend some time exploring algorithms and data structures. You've already learned a bit about these ideas throughout the program. For example, they've been mentioned with the machine-learning techniques that you've used and the data structures (such as lists, dictionaries, arrays, and data frames) that you've put data into. But now you'll learn about their fundamentals in a more formal fashion.

Instead of focusing on the most sophisticated algorithms that you can implement or the most complex data structures that you can use, you'll focus on the central ideas of these concepts, with two specific goals in mind.

Firstly, understanding these essentials will make you a better data scientist. It will help you understand the tools that you've already started using; you'll learn how to use them in the most efficient way. Secondly, algorithms and data structures are core topics in a lot of data science interviews. Data structures and algorithms are rightly considered part of the backbone of programming, so employers often like to see how well you understand these fundamentals.

You'll come out of this module with a better understanding of the following key topics. You'll also be more prepared to answer interview questions about these topics.

* The differences between lists, linked lists, stacks, and queues, as well as their relative efficiencies with fundamental operations like adding and removing terms
* What a fundamental step is and how it relates to Big O notation
* How to program a few variations of a rudimentary sorting algorithm
* Why and how to use tree-based data structures

Before you get started, keep in mind that this is a notoriously difficult subject. In fact, plenty of data scientists working in the field are not masters of these topics. But being exposed to these topics will make you a better and more efficient data scientist. Don't be surprised if it feels more abstract than a lot of what you've covered so far, and remember that you can always reach out to the Thinkful team if you have any questions.
