## Project Euler

Now that you've learned a little bit about algorithms and written some simple but essential code, it's time to test your new skills and put them into action. For data scientists and other engineers who want to practice their mathematical programming skills, there is one resource that stands out: [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

Project Euler is a fantastic set of mathematical programming problems. Use the skills that you've learned here to find efficient solutions to the first 10 problems. Once you've found your own solutions, look around the web for other people's Python solutions to see other ways that people have approached these problems.

It's a good idea to revisit Project Euler and continue to work through these problems. They are a fantastic way to sharpen your mathematical programming skills.
