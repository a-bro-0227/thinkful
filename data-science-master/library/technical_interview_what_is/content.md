Whereas behavioral interviews are meant to give a potential employer a broad sense of your behavioral traits, your past experience, and what makes you tick, the technical interview is meant to narrowly measure your ability to succeed in analyzing challenging data and coding problems. You'll be presented with a data science problem and be expected to investigate and propose a solution using a computer programming language. 

For this program, that language will be Python, which you have a great command of. So, will the technical interview ask you to draft a Jupyter Notebook? Work on a script in Spyder?

Nope, neither of those! In fact, you won't even be programming at a computer at all. Instead, you'll be coding at a whiteboard—hence the other name for a technical interview: a whiteboard interview. 

What does that mean for your coding workflow? Well, there will be no IDE (Integrated Development Environment) nudging you to make the proper indentations and include all parentheses. There will be no Stack Overflow to copy and paste from. There won't even be a `help` function! Writing code from a whiteboard is awkward and even unnatural—that's why it will be so important to prepare under these same circumstances. 


## When is a technical interview?

Technical interviews often come toward the end of the interview process. By this point, the employer has established that you would be a good cultural fit and that you know at least the basics of data science. With the technical interview, employers can assess your technical chops in real time, along with getting a sense of how you might work in a team and under pressure. 


## Who conducts a technical interview? 

Because technical interviews often fall in later stages of the interview process, they are usually conducted by the hiring department rather than human resources or recruiters. Technical interviews are highly technical and require in-depth field knowledge to conduct and evaluate. 

While the hiring manager might conduct the interview, it's also common to have junior-level data scientists involved. After all, these are the people you are more likely to work with on a day-to-day basis.

## Where is a technical interview?

Again, because the technical interview is usually toward the end of the interview, it is almost always in person. The employer wants to meet you in real life and get to know you in an analog setting. 

However, remote work is becoming more common, especially in technical fields, so your interview may be conducted digitally. The basic format will still hold in this setting, but rather than a real whiteboard, you'll share your screen and write on a digital whiteboard. This is how your Thinkful mock technical interview will be conducted, but you should assume that your real-life technical interviews will be conducted in person. 

## Why technical interviews?

Technical interviews assess a multitude of abilities. Hiring managers can evaluate all of the following factors:

- **Is this candidate a good listener?** Data scientists can spend a lot of time with clients (whether internal or external), gathering requirements, advising, and other client-facing duties. A technical interview simulates how a data scientist would interact with these clients when working through a problem on the spot.
- **Is this candidate a good communicator?** In a technical interview, a candidate should demonstrate good communication when walking through a data science problem with colleagues.
- **Is this candidate calm and collected?** "Thinking aloud" in front of a potential employer sounds intimidating, right? Well, that's the gist of a technical interview! A technical interview allows organizations to see whether candidates can work through a problem in real time.
- **Is this candidate hacker-savvy?** Data scientists spend tremendous amounts of time gathering and cleaning data sources. A strong command of computer programming is essential to execute and automate these tasks. 
- **Is this candidate math and statistics savvy?** Copying and pasting from the internet is a time-honored but potentially dangerous practice in data science. The code might run and even give a decent result, but how do you know the findings are valid? Technical interviews break down data science problems to test prior knowledge, intuition, and the ability to ask questions. 


## Assignment

Tech companies like Google and Facebook are notorious for their interview processes, which include technical interviews. Conduct a web search for technical interviews at companies where you'd like to work.  What did you learn?
