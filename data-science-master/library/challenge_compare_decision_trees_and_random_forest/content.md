Now that you've learned about random forests and decision trees, try an exercise in accuracy. You know that random forests are basically a collection of decision trees. But how do the two models compare in terms of accuracy?

To start this exercise, pick a dataset. It could be one you've worked with before or it could be a new dataset. Then build the best decision tree that you can.

Now, try to match that with the simplest random forest that you can. For this exercise, measure simplicity with [runtime](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1557571/how-to-get-time-of-a-python-program-execution). Compare that to the runtime of the decision tree. This is imperfect, but just go with it.

Hopefully, out of this you'll see the power of random forests, but you'll also see their potential costs. Remember, in the real world, you won't necessarily be dealing with thousands of rows. There may be millions, billions, or even more.
