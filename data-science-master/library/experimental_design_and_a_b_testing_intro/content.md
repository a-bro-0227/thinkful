In this module, you'll turn to the *science* side of data science, focusing on experimental design. Designing an experiment is the only way to get bespoke dataâ€”that is, data that is perfectly fitted to the question or questions at hand. Unlike working with existing datasets, properly designed experiments will have all the variables that you care about, measured in the way that you think is best, collected in a context that emphasizes the features that you want to understand.

Experimental design can be a powerful tool in your data science arsenal. And like all powerful tools, it needs to be handled the right way.

In this module, you'll learn about A/B testing. You'll also learn about how to evaluate a good experiment, writing a research proposal, and analytical techniques to use when an experiment yields non-normal data.
