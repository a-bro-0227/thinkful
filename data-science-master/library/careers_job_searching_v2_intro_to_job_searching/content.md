## Learning objective

By the end of this checkpoint, you should be able to explain the purpose of job searching.


## Overview

As you probably know from past experience, applying to jobs involves both strategy and luck. Even when you apply to jobs that you're perfectly qualified for—even when your resume is flawless—only a [small percentage of your applications](https://www.topresume.com/career-advice/7-top-job-search-statistics) turn into interviews. And transitioning careers comes with its own unique set of obstacles. 

Luckily for you, your Thinkful careers team is here to guide you through this process.

This module covers the best strategies for finding job listings, understanding which job listings you should apply to, navigating internal and external recruiters, bypassing online applications through cold outreach, and writing effective cover letters.
