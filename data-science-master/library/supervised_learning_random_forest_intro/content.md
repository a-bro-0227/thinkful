In this module, you'll learn about two of the most common and powerful models of supervised learning: the decision tree and the random forest. Random forest will be your first example of an *ensemble model*, which is a new modeling technique that you'll return to throughout the program. Specifically, in this module, you'll learn about the following:

 * Decision trees
 * Entropy in modeling
 * Random forests
 * Ensemble models
 * The ID3 algorithm for making a decision tree

When you're ready, continue on to get started with decision trees.
