So, you've chosen to take a journey through time?

Good call.

Time has been lingering around a lot of topics that you've explored in the program. It's been on the periphery but has rarely taken center stage. For anything that you're modeling that happens over some period rather than simultaneously, time likely plays a role. It makes intuitive sense, therefore, that time should be modeled.

But so far, this program hasn't really emphasized the tools needed to properly deal with that dimension. Now, that will change.

This module will cover some of the fundamental ways that data scientists can deal with time. You'll learn some theory about processes and a concept called _stochasticity_. Then you'll learn about some ways to transform your current toolset, particularly linear modeling, to handle time. Lastly, you'll get familiar with ARIMA, the classic model for time series analysis.

You'll leave this specialization with a better grasp of how to deal with one of the fundamental elements of modeling: time. When you're ready, continue on.
