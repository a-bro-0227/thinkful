Your mock interview will be based on one of three real-life postings for data science job positions:

1. [Ecommerce and entertainment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1awVBkeu4Fo-XxSE2yUdE8t_OxW9U_D6r6pedzznpnIo/edit?usp=sharing)
2. [Government relations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PPcGwdC1JpJf2Y-YGnMPWa5azMpW4MUme8yR7ijPtL4/edit?usp=sharing)
3. [Banking and financial technology (fintech)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ll-nP4QzoRvN8MdYwieqtIETT3fIIb6FthJtjcRdAro/edit?usp=sharing) 

Prepare for a mock role interview using the steps in the previous checkpoint. The interview is simulated in that you did not choose to apply for the position. While you might not be interested in working for the company or industry, the requirements of each posting overlaps with the training you are receiving in this program, thus it should interest you at some level as a data scientist.  

Each role interview will begin with a broad overview of the job's description and your own background, followed by a series of questions related to your abilities and knowledge and how they align with the role and company. It will last approximately 45 minutes. 

In the next module, you will be able to schedule a video mock role interview. Below, you will find questions that will guide your preparation for that interview.
