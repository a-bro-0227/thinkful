Now that you've completed the *Natural language processing* module, you're ready to develop your own NLP project and enrich your project portfolio. When you're doing your project, follow the instructions below.

* You can use any data that you like. There are many available text datasets on Kaggle, and you can use them if you like. Or, if you have access to substantial computing power, you can also use large collections of text. But it's a good idea to pick a modest-size dataset so that you can experiment a lot without waiting too much on running the computations.
* Your dataset can include nontext data along with some text data. However, having some text data in your dataset is obligatory.
* In your project, do the following:

    1. First, make sure to clean your data. You can use the data-cleaning techniques that you practiced in the *Text preprocessing* checkpoint. But keep in mind that every text dataset is likely to have its own particular cleaning requirements. Make sure to clean your dataset appropriately.
    2. If your dataset includes numerical features, then work on them for cleaning purposes; for example, deal with any missing values and outliers.
    3. After the data-cleaning step, do some exploratory data analysis to get to know your dataset better. In the exploratory data analysis, analyze your numerical features as well as your text features. If you feel that converting your text features into a numerical form is required for your exploratory analysis, then you can do this step after vectorizing your text.
    4. Convert your text features into numerical form. You're free to choose your method. You can use BoW, TF-IDF, word2vec, or any other method that you'd like to experiment with. It's a good idea to use several methods so that you can compare the results with respect to the methods that you apply. 
    5. You can choose whatever NLP task you want. You're completely free in your choice. Here are some possible options:
        * Sentiment analysis
        * Text classification
        * Topic modeling
        * Developing a more sophisticated chatbot than what you've already developed in this module
        * Training a deep-learning model for a supervised or unsupervised task of your choice

Submit your solutions to the following tasks as a link to your Jupyter Notebook on GitHub. The Thinkful team will get back to you with feedback shortly. Good luck!
