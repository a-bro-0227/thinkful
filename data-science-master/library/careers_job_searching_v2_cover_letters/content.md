## Learning objectives

By the end of this checkpoint, you should be able to create effective cover letters.


## Overview

Cover letters are often the most dreaded part of applying to jobs. Yet it remains common practice to submit a cover letter alongside your resume each time that you apply. Why is this? There are actually a few good reasons, especially for career changers. 

- Your cover letter adds personality to your application. It gives employers a glimpse of the person behind the accomplishments listed on your resume. They gain insight into your interests, values, and expertise, which makes you a more memorable candidate. 

- Your cover letter shows off your communication skills. The ability to clearly articulate your thoughts is beneficial for every job and, therefore, matters to every employer. 

- Your cover letter can highlight anything in your background that's not obvious on your resume but does add value for the employer. Resumes often lack context, but your cover letter can compensate for this. 

One thing to note, though: cover letters aren't really about you. They're about the employer. So the focus should always be about what you can offer the employer—not how the job can benefit you. 

This checkpoint is about how to keep the employer in mind and what to include when you're writing and styling your cover letters. 


## Cover letter components

Like resumes, your cover letters should be tailored to the job listings that you're applying to; it won't work to use a generic cover letter for every application. But don't worry—if you're applying for the same _types_ of jobs, you can repurpose the majority of the content in your cover letter to suit different job listings. This makes writing a cover letter a fast and painless process. 

The following section identifies the components that all of your cover letters should include. 


### 1. Salutation

Start with a salutation that, if possible, is personalized to the employer—the actual person who's reviewing your cover letter. For example, you could write, "Dear Walter Stevenson." This requires researching the company first, which shows your willingness to make an effort and seek out answers on your own. 

If you're unable to learn who the exact person reviewing your application is, it's okay to say something like "Dear Hiring Manager," or "Team Google." (But avoid "To Whom It May Concern," which feels extra impersonal.) 


### 2. First paragraph: Stating your intent and skills

In the first paragraph of your cover letter, your goal is to identify the job that you're applying to, show enthusiasm for the job or company, and highlight two or three of your top skills related to the job listing. 

When it comes to showing enthusiasm, get specific. Find something about the company or job that excites you, whether it's a connection to a personal interest, a friend who works at the company and said something positive about the work environment, or a company value or product that resonates with you. For example, "I have been playing Nintendo games my entire life, from Super Mario Bros. to Fortnite and beyond, so it would be a dream to join your team as a software engineer," is a lot more compelling than, "It would be so cool to work at Nintendo." 


### 3. Middle paragraphs: Proving your qualifications

Next, in one or two short paragraphs, show how your background qualifies you for the job that you're applying to. For each of the top skills that you listed in your introduction, provide a concrete example of you learning or using that skill—like mentioning that you just graduated from your Thinkful program or describing one of your recent projects. 

This shows the employer that you're not just saying that you have a skill or exaggerating; you're proving it with your experience. 

This is also the place for you to mention any of your valuable experience that isn't obvious on your resume. For example, if you're applying to a job at a startup and you've worked at a startup in the past, this is information that employers would probably like to know but might not understand just from looking at your resume. 


### 4. Last paragraph: Wrapping up

In your final paragraph, thank the employer for taking time out of their day to review your application. Tell them how they can contact you if they have questions or want to connect. Remember to show a little enthusiasm for the job, too (it's your last chance)! For example, you could write, "I appreciate you taking the time to review my application. Please reach out at 206-123-4567 or becca@gmail.com if you have any questions. I hope to speak with you soon!"


### 5. Closing

Finally, include a sign-off with your name. "Sincerely" is standard, but it's okay to use something a little more creative. Here are a few options: 

* Sincerely
* Best
* Thank you
* Thanks
* Gratefully


## Cover letter style

After you write your cover letter, styling it is easy. 


- **Length:** Keep your cover letters short—about 300 words or less. 
- **Typeface:** Use the same typeface for your resume and cover letter. This makes your complete application uniform, polished, and professional. Similarly, if you use a header for your resume, use the same header for your cover letters too.
- **Tone:** When writing cover letters, you want your tone to strike a balance between professional and personable. Employers are real people; they'll feel more connected to you if you sound like a friendly person instead of an emotionless robot. Consider the company that you're applying to and adjust your formality accordingly. For example, a conversational tone may be appreciated at a casual startup, whereas a government office probably prefers formality. When in doubt, err on the side of formality.


## When to include a cover letter

You might be asking yourself these questions: 

* Are cover letters really necessary? 
* Should I submit a cover letter if it's optional? 

Here's the thing: 

Yes, cover letters are necessary as long as employers continue to ask for them. 

When it's an option, choosing to submit a thoughtful cover letter can make you positively stand out from the candidates who don't bother. It shows employers that you're willing to put in extra effort and that you care about the job. 

The only time that you shouldn't submit a cover letter is when the job listing expressly says not to. In that case, it could annoy an employer if you ignore their almost certainly intentional note.

## Assignment

With the insight gained in this checkpoint:

1. In a Google Doc, write a cover letter for a specific job listing that you'd like to apply to. 
2. Review [this grading rubric](https://chegg-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/p/gina_hinton/EeYYnGASNXtHv1UIR8AAvNAB3Ss3Vk7favipcmXVsjNOLw?e=xAfI2Y) to ensure that you're meeting all of the necessary requirements for this assignment.
3. Update the sharing permissions so that other people with the link to your Doc can edit your cover letter. (This allows the Careers Team to make notes and help fix typos.)
4. Submit a link to your cover letter. 

At this point, the Careers Team will review your resume and work alongside you to make any necessary revisions. On average, cover letter submissions go through two rounds of revisions.
