## Learning objectives

By the end of this checkpoint, you should be able to explain the purpose of interviews.


## Overview

Interviewing is a key part of the hiring process. It can take more than [20 applications to get a single interview](https://talent.works/2017/09/22/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-job-60-days-if-youre-in-hr-or-sales/), so it's important to make a good impression every opportunity that you get. Luckily, there's a lot that you can do to prepare for your next interview, even before it's scheduled. 

This module helps you understand and prepare for interviews, including how to answer common behavioral interview questions, like, "Tell me about yourself." You will also learn how to answer questions that are specific to your new career path, highlight your relevant experience, and effectively negotiate a salary.
