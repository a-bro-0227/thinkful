Now, take your Keras skills and go build another neural network. Pick your dataset, but make sure to select one of the more complex typesâ€”possibly even nonnumeric. Use Keras to make five implementations of your network. Compare them in computational complexity as well as accuracy. Then, given that tradeoff, decide which implementation you like best.

Your dataset should be sufficiently large for a neural network to perform well; look for a dataset with thousands of samples. And try to pick something that takes advantage of neural networks' ability to have both feature extraction and supervised capabilities. In other words, don't pick something with an easy-to-consume list of features already generated for you (though neural networks can still be useful in those contexts).

Note that if you want to use an unprocessed image dataset, [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/) is a useful package for converting to importable numerics.
